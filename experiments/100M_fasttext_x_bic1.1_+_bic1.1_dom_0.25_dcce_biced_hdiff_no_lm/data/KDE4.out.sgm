<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mechanical translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made dependent on the translation without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making them readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Extensions... Open the card card Tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & Konqueror; on Extras Crush. then you can view the page that has crashed & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Views filter module (also called the Folder Filters) can be reached in the & contentor; menu bar under Extras Keyfilter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; s current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM Tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory of local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists of plotting nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected when it is located far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command, you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the sitemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation use the rectangles of meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View Color Mode, can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby display errors are caused by limitations on the character of the delusion). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps write algorithms, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the case of the Treemap in & FSView, this goal will not always be complied with. frames are drawn to render the entries no longer available. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How partitioning the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. for captions and to avoid space losses through frames, it is always beneficial to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns, or recursive partitions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal displayed area for an entry on the View menu item in Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Photo Gallery module can be found in the & contentor; menu under Extras Image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiti. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitiate; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded using KDE Image Plugins Interface (Manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & quot; programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digipation; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use these shortcuts, your web browser opens a page in the fault reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitiation; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digitized; then we would encourage you to ask other users of & digitized; ask and hopefully soon to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit digipation; visit homepage to learn about & digitize news about released versions and other information.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved in & digitized; participation is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digitized;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitize; start the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data collection is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digitiate; will also be used as an aldisk library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & digitiate; view each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder, you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitiates; duralizes recursively the library path in its entirety. you can't exclude any subfolders unless it is in hidden folders. this allows you to add extracurbs & digipation; do this by inserting a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as icons. you can change that by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album symbol. for more details see the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & digitized; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and My Stables to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you can handle digitizing. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw-cameras in the help of RohkameraBackup.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderMode and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiti. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digipation; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digiCam can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to view thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digitizing is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (Handbook) is an approach to develop a modular structure for & digitized;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can be manipulated in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digitized; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common media: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Films and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name will only work if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos taken by & digitized are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have a scanner set up, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan album Import Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Importing screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the next menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method of marking your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. selecting the collection from the tool bar or sort by collection by collection. if you want to add or delete collections from the list, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons elders, average, new ester: these set the date on the oldest, the latest image or that of the average of the album. to do this, try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digiHi, the first picture in the album will be a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview quot;. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included only in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitiate; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keywordlist on the left bottom of the main window. album collections always have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. what information they are, can be changed via settings digial. select here the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse cursor a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the Introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about & digitized; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements. you can choose between viewing the images, slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image editing... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select. in the edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digitized; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize them to your needs, if your program is not enumerated, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing through other image processing programs it may lead to problems with the metadata that is contained in the picture. some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitiate; Set two options for turning. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo taken from & digitized; erase, it will be moved to the trashers of & kde; F8 image deletion or removal if you'd rather want to delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumbelstequot; organizes your photos by means of the data. & digipation; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. Tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also unfold parts of the tree & quot; My keywordsong quot; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. besides, the keywords are re-imported as soon as & digitized; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or on an existing keyword and then choose New Keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will become the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and discarding it. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My Delay quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use keywords, you first need to add keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My Delay quot; alternatively you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can use a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords you assigned to it. in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have completed a photo with keywords, it will appear under the thumbnail of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu only shows the keywords which have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be shifted using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower right angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Neon er Search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures displayed again. if Search didn't find anything, then the lamp will red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters that which you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search is done. the results are displayed in the My Search list in the main window. the text box Save search as is used to make your request a name in My Search list. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Edit Search the form will appear to enter the search returned with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching. for more information, see the Advanced Search Tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digi.s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albayatenbank. all rules are added by line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations Show All..., A..., No... or At least....</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitiate; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two signatures, the more they match. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar. by means of a swell the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand colored sketch: draw a quick sketch and a quick sketch; find the matching images. also here, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Minirange. you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitiate; provides an illuminating table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window will be opened. if you are back in & digidy; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare, in the left or right pane of the window and place there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you can select a preview from the toolbar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the images, then they are also executed with the other picture.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly expel from a picture series. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it on the left. this simplifies it through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the illuminating table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivoting feature that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the picture, you need to click and hold the & LMB; in the Preview Mode, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in the same way as in other views. just use the zoom-knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital Stock Manager considers every part of the process following the image made up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we focus on the process for digital photo photographers the & digitized; use. we view the download, rename, remove, group, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexed, secures, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a specific photo for longer. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digitized;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very quick searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location, unless you were in one year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata into & digitiate the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data can be written to the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate dot in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? add & digiGET; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, lettering and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digitized; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dragging one sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata intersect. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in fact composed of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to just let anyone see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">From the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer then you begin to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motif that you moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitized; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. KDE even provides you with a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time according to your wishes in the labeling and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of utilizing geolocation are already innumerable and become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travel using pictures with geographic information. this then shows the photos at the location. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and designates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digitized; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author Title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify them in the picture. for private individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, current impacts, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, asterance prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kind of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are talking about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you may not be trusted more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a cheaper software called IsoBuster that works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recorder on high quality media in a non-propriate format. after that, you should read the media with a description, date & author and afterwards store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturing capabilities include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk failures</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos are the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common cause of error is SMART. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error. some of SMART's errors denounce the imminent failure. these are particularly readers and publishers. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices account for electric shocks not much, this can cause severe damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause persistent keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, as there is also a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power if a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and to shut down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in electricity problems with the cost of avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember to burn all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more, in case of Flickr dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies the offer includes a backup and a distributed storage. thus, they are not asteroid.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until one day there is no protection for it. nobody seems to have thought about it. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses because they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system, which is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebooks and 46% on workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the percentage of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most think. it leads to less damage than e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been spotted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source File Systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology continues to evolve there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not charge anyone else for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash hits you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, there is a common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made. this fuse comes to a versioning system the next with the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync copies only the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing appliances,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseen due to your nature, you have to consider all that is going on today with caution and re-evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to manage a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was detected by the system, but don't append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBS; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software can be read, you can create them yourself. this task is made easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG may recommend relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and have a slow communication. we would like to recommend this format to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). however, with some cameras you can save your images in this format. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licence-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. it is designed based on the TIFF / EP format and obliges to the use of metadata. a handful camera controller is already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image Resource & quot; technology of the nineties. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo, mostly in raw format, as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there may be problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is obsolete. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digitized, then you should add the metadata again. these were, under certain circumstances, cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitized. in section adding a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albatatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digitize your digital camera, connect them to the computer, turn the camera to display mode and turn on. for more details, refer to the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. with some cameras it may take a while. if the connection is made, a thumbnail indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturers' Screen, GPS etc. this information is the same as the Metadata page bar, or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All. this will download all photos from your camera in a single album in & digiti.. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we advise you to check if the photos were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All button or download selected button, a dialog will pop up with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of the existing albums in the My albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitih; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, then you have to select them first and then delete selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully loaded into a & digitized album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera file, you should do so via the camera's menu, as this is much quicker.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually reused after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames, if you load photos from different recording series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for date based subsets. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S e.g. in the edit field. to do this, turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you may have the option to change the file names in lower case letters, or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitized; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitiate; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to run an automatic rotation during download. not all the cameras provide this information. in the page bar page, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it lets you digitize; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select Automatic Turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subdirectory. not all the cameras provide this information. in the page strip meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and digitized in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based baskets on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file using the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digitize; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width grams and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map a territory by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, user who can locate the location of the photo, or just want to document that aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exi2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, the semitones and map references? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about a re-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Camera with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the exiftool of Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy co-ordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digipation; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digiti. to access these settings, you need to set up in the Settings menu; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on saved preview or start image editing. so you place the default behavior of & digitized; fix when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardidentity and Copyright Data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected from the camera interface when downloading. even with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the photographer's profession. these can be names such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the & digitized database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digi--without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the images. note: in images that already contain inscriptions, they are overwritten by digitizing.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse is resting in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digipation; to show, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digitized; album folder that has none of these extensions, by & digitized; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Setting & digitizing settings can be set to the default values on this page. however, every time you open the brightness, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can use the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF photos. this reduces the size of TIFF photos. it has no impact on image quality, since the DEFLATE algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy settings, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digipation, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is rapidly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. this option is ignored for other cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned into the settings due to the inability of your camera to view the pointed white. to do so, use the setting of solid white in the settings. the setting colors will cause some unusual results, as they will attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digipated; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructions, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitized; -image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data coming from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digitiate; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for color evasion, since you are carried out during the blank conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digipation; information such as the colour information of a color space in the other languages can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if an image is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder can be used to set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc or / home / user / .color / icc, where you can save all your profiles. & digitized; then examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your images are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon that do not have color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the finish: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digitized; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digi.These modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project on http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / zoom, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digitize your digital camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digitized; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog option for dragging &gt; images in the trashers, you can adjust the conversation between & digi.When deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes caused by the right sidebar can be tackled silently by & digitized; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without asking back questions. otherwise, you have to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digitize the display of the welcome screen; this accelerates the boot process of & digitized under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup At start for new photos is forcing & digitizing; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digitized;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, ask & digipower; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digitized; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitizing, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitiate; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview and selection of the item Advertisement / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your imagery. some of them are available as modules in & digiti. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can use it to save it as a file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or Restore image processing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every image processing action can be undone or restored. the last action can undo you by modifying or recreating editing by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should revoke the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo Ctrl; -Shift-Z for reproducing.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; hold a moment longer using the revert or restore button in the toolbar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be undone or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the user menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarger Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come in the normal view, in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can also change it in the & digiplug settings dialog. you can view it from the & digial. view the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture previews can be printed out of your selection. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export job supervisor. if you follow the wizard you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitized; main window has a side bar at the right edge, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is available, without the navigation path, also in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tab is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view you can enter or paste inscriptions with unlimited size. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button called More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you select a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can either be applied with a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the key shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding is followed by the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a drop-down box with the keywords used previously in this & digipation session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The entry field at the bottom is a further relief when typing keywords on a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please refer to the section Keyword Filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page header keyword filters is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - date, drop and search view is used. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. thereupon, a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keywordfilter is on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right-hand corner tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Diverse.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and established that it is a or should be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an extended search using all the elements in the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button. the options will look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digidy; s specific implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanners to have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanners and that match the colors you want to print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed choices at every point of image processing workflows. additionally, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and think about color blurging?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huhorseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger coloured spots, please visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calligraphy my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to calligraphy your monitor since sRGB is calligraphy. if you work as RGB colour space, you need either to callibration your monitor on sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to proceed manually.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, offset, automatic balance and contrast enhance from the menu Korrigate Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values across the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright colors and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Adding Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a new jiustizing of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited since a color space is worked with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym protected. you start it through the menu entry Colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically match the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Upload buttons do exactly that. each setting of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality pictures. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assigning color profiles. color toning can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Colors Sound-value Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for tonal correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The Colour Upgrade tool provides four colour effects, a solar isation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing solar isation, also called Sabatier, was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then the development of the picture completed. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the picture. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar isation effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers, especially those who barely leave landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large pictures, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and illuminance of the photo. you can experiment on the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to correct the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to move the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will automatically adjust for all shadows, medium and sun shades. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most sensible. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos a red marker is to be seen. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve displaying the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. each curve you created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to show overexposed pixels. if you find more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digitized; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colors-mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you are also the tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the faraway. colourless consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern looks different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce color noise.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any blender setting for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image can be seen under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to be abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panf Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. so, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotary filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Semperaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of the leaching of a pressure and the re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digitizing tool to apply texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the modified one (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Adding & digitizing; adding tools frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the confines of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you enter the desired frame type for your image. the image flirts with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), edged around it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image, decorated with the frame, will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this can also be done at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text output, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitized; apply tool template you can put a stencil on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu Image Template apply in the image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digipated template database, just send an email in English to & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil folder using the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be shown for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder appears automatically. the selection of a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons below which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the stencil on the whole picture, you have to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitiate; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy to create, but especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur Mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it does not sharpens a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitization process to sum up colours with minimal differences to a coloring point. this in turn leads to sharp edges becoming a bit blurred. this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed on paper. SLR cameras typically need more after sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool suit. this can be used with the menu item Korrigging sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, since the results do not work very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. you can reach it via the menu entry Corridor. under refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to use the menu entry Correcise softness and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or amount enhances the effect. if you make the blur of the mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images permit larger radii. therefore, you should sharpens images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is the percentage between the original and the blurred picture added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference. thus, a minimum difference can be defined thereby for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool attempts an image to & quot; refocused. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. refocusing is usually achieved to mask better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by rejecting colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'n Fitting. the Gauß régime has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original quellpixel. in most cases, the inverse of the Gauß 'folding is affected very strongly by the distant pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but then pay attention to icons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the picture quality is very bad. a high value will still pollute the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß' sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is Gauss. this is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the sharpness or the gauge 'sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, ungodly masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the implant masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blur. the FIR Wiener Filters is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original non-sharp color image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the focal correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want fine adjustment of the filter settings, you can use tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothness over the image. whereas larger values tend to smooth homogeneous regions and keep details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is flattened close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD-noise, a high value produces wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: the higher this value, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm passes through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle measurement as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stride width [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel polishing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the run time. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and load buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window will remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius turns over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front to determine brightness changes. if it is increased, you may need to re-adjust the edges of the filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamblyance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also pollute the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother, if it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this to sharpen molluscs with the menu item Correcise softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digidig; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitised pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting. the texturer's composition is carried out with a different tool, the image error correction. the restoration algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce artifacts: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactors quot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Upload buttons do exactly that. each setting of photo restorations can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious screen on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Digitized and digitized; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel images to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGAxi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Picture button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you take the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and automatically loads it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all projections.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic interface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitisation correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 for the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise uneven effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's cinematic and gray scales of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the correction of the vignette and with three more the imaging of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of highest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, you let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digipation; image processing from the menu Color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignette in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a correction and contrast correction was also carried out in the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitized; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but shallow at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, any distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion 4th grades. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thereby corrects the first grade. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The Tonnen- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. in the best way, perform this correction as the first. if you re-cut an image and then perform a ton-shaped correction the effect would seem apparent to the falcon.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you a vertical and a horizontal line of assistance. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the Tonnen- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform Add from image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, e.g. images from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red movie of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for filming and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Adding Film Corsage if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO slider changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter uses color channels to reproduce infrared, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitized; Filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grazing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy view specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited the (2). the film sensitivity used is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controlled the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal jze. images of whose gradients should change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch out. this would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the value value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Die & digival; Filter Gravure shapes your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engravings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equals 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of infinity effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blur: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates blur a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurs the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement blur: blurs the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening Unity: wipes the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunsharpenfe: blurs the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: takes the paint tank in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of droplets on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digitized; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. to do this, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it by mirroring or turning it into the right orientation. you can find the tools to use in the Transformation bar or transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use some kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digipation; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: the higher this value, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stutter for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently underestimated surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to compose a picture. to crop a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or File Save file from the File menu to save the newly cut image.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After Aspect Ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the transverse format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After Aspect uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified balance measurements are stored in the EXIF-tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup help settings allow you to show help in order to better put your pictures together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-paragus, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it has already been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid help lines when composing a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third-party rule, the golden spiral creates a fluid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">One more rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button, you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digitized; image processing and the tool free rotation. select transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown in the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Auto cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option calculates the image a bit after the turn. however, note the warning above.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angles at the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shearing, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not turning, the image is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shears your image by using horizontal and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the sea, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two notches generating twice as much blurging and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digipation; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to list all file formats available on their system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digipation; shows only files in formats that know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, then digitized; you can change this list of file extensions to & digi.In the configuration section you will find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitiate; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter by & digi.In the configuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with & digitized;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, molluscs, noise suppression, refocusing, masking, & etc.. use a single dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter applied to the current image. below you will see & quot; texture applied quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">The upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and under exposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame using the mouse inside the image and discard it on the part of the image you want to preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page header features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Minirange. you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Pallets files that are installed by & kde can either apply to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -Settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets, or browse the folders by files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphic; -dot; graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. programs that are & graphiviz; programs are obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; -project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphic interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphic; -dot; graphs. the & graph; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; shows graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & Conqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate spans the graphs and shows in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or open the graphene in & kgraphviewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program which requires the & graph; tool & dot; for representing the graphs required. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar will only open the symbol file and the (empty) list will contain last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10. below, you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgraphical, loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also memorize your decision so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Configuring..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as later change.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the sections of the graph, which come on one side, should be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a page distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut shop page allows you to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of & kgraph viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that each time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to set the start behaviour of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files at the last session or not) or decide to be prompted for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears in a single click in the main window with the & RMBN, opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between various & graphical layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphiviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphs. it produces images according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspring model layout for non-eritified graphs. it uses the Fruchthman-pure gold heuristic, and includes a multi-latent for the handling of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm assigns the nodes circle shape according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command you can add & eg; the & graph, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or ungeritified) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for non-eritified graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan Photos: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you have to have Kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item images, a dialog appears, which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. here, select the source you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by choosing the default default ducrhe custom to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window will be displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan, you need wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create the image to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected in the menu Imported - &gt; screen photo... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay quite enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo broadcast on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication so that it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked on Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exports to Flickr to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once after you have set any other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as a keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module-export module has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic location allows GPS coordinates to be added and edited in the metadata of a picture. the geographic data is stored in the EXIF database of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic location module provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the dialog shown above appears. in order to run a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which displays the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time variance indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog is marked by a call to the next you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region in question and increase sie.Perform this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the altitude must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to attach GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Photo Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you just need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page. if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all associated images. for this, select a folder on which you have write permission. a sub-folder named KIPIHTMLOutput, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, it also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail image allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Rider for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as turns, zooming or sliding. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exival to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide au.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. for burning the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images they want to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the Portfolio. you can also change the images or the contents of the list there.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be adjusted next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a suggestion appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the jpegs and ImageMagick packages on the right-hand button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The job supervisor allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photoggers. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter windows then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG utilises a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or you later use it further, you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start conversion with the trigger button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all the images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. for this purpose four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation, and the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change of size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-treatment: prepare the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will appear with the images selected by you. you can add more images via the Add button. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the images list to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent by using the Pictures button.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your email client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected by you are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at one time. most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically closed so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the closing button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with questions like you would like to have displayed your slideshow appears. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of the images will appear in the lower left corner during presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The images randomly select make sure that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">With a delay between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can get with & kphotoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, there are now in each group, i.e. people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser's view changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images on which both persons are shown are shown. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the pictures of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol before their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; but for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture for this.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to select which image to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to open the picture pane window (described in more detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the check-in window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you look for the entry in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can preview this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total datas, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a section of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to specific names, as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the Quick Start, the screenshots and the introductions videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry cphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries thumbnail from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview window) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select a range, you will only display images of this time in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of Content, Layout and Objective. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created, which is to be seen on the overview page. more information on export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without a description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. note that & kphotoalbum; therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why this is not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that have a resolution of 1600x1200 for example.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a smaller transmission time. if he wants to get a picture bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this Settings section you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you set here should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will have to copy them to it manually. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have related all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may, of course, create an HTML page to view the images. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the picture information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if in the file there is only one link to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that this file can be shared as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images, which you can view through the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy manuals to the .kim file, you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically move to .kim file copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zipped files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu item... select, becomes & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category of people of the imported file (if you are a domain), while this category is named by your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file to import, and which categories will match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps from (1) Specifying information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will find the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can use by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">We have described how to set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window you can find a list of the categories and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digipam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin interface. next information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always first test new modules using the demo database before using them to your own pictures. the demo database can be used either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the Help menu. don't tell me I didn't warn you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use together with KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates and kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album has to be released & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, you will do so, so whether you have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the setup dialog and select in the module section which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the moment, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain very much information, as you do not yet have any information about your pictures. in the section we will click on the picture to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to annotate any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, illustrated on all pictures Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks by using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can, therefore, that the names used are moved up to find and assign people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click the Sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may wish to edit all the selected images and add them to the images. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the thumbnail of the image to the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you that it is a super group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Notation dialog context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the lath that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... button, which will allow you to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to get this window displayed later, use the Options... and then close the window. see this procedure in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or any pictures if you do not set a filter. for example, see here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now, the window will appear to you, which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, you may have the images stored somewhere to get & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the upper right corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these pictures too. however, you can't view these pictures using the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to extract files from the folders and copy them back. & kphotoalbum; so far, do not support the insertion of the respective CD. so if you want trouble, how to avoid confusion of your pictures, please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible for others and click on Current View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and select the menu item Anything besides current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the Add Images, whereby all the images you have blocked have to be hidden. if you want to get the pictures shown again, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change the password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can only read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the look of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. this can be started from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it displays the image, but additional information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available on the viewer after a right click.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the appropriate entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom out. to zoom in, you can just pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button, you can zoom out again The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom roeck is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. with the control key you zoom the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos show that they are in and out with the plus and minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. in the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you might prefer to mark only the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poorly while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in this picture you can see an image where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your pictures, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add them all at once with notes. this is described in. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be shown in the preview screen. if you can view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow you & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">To turn off the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the image from the contextual menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & krepvmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the subobject of an object that has already been selected, since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error message. then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties Tab and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subset item (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wiremodel view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. Objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it arbitrarily. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map icon in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the author to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross at the beginning bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... saving. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & krepvmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the Rendering menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu of Render Modi... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the picture cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality combination field you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render features can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam each pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, in addition, details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling contains the neighboring pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is further divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colours.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of each pixel. if the difference between the colored values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then amounts to:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the colors exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. you can adjust the maximum depth of the recursion with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu item Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & krepvmodeler; not yet the full range of commands from & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source text in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste into & krepvmodeler; and in your editor you can add source for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & krepvmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document retention and version. supported are 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example height field data) in paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to add the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for displaying the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scales and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high attention to extended projections, all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. see the Render-Modi section for more details on the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section you will explain how you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Field Default window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & krepvmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders present shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a select arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with gates you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map sheet view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & krepvmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you produce. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree change immediately in accordance with these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (Insert Endless Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& krepvmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can insert an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is now showing the level as well, if at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the preview window, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and start the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set correctly now. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called one color. then edit the entry color list in the object tree. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select Monochrome each time and change the colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & krepvmodeler; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the sphere would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose First subitem and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on a sphere of pigment, then choose one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection settings already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you would like & krepvmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracen, the rendering of hypothetical rays shoots from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect. thus, the scene Pixel is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & krepvmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have not saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. this menu item can only be selected when you have modified the Edit feature.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or rewrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & krepvmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying key shortcuts. with this option, you can modify or add new commands preset by using this option for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the & LMBN; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all the pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In Dialogue Configuration - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and Machining and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the two other, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color, which you can set further below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this item is activated, load & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image. this reduces the delay if you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may need to set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands. thus make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripting.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script to see if all the necessary modules are available and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start with require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for fortwitter) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; any KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the exec () function is mostly used. thus, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for more information about the new track (for example, the metadata or unit length) with DCOP functions.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customer.Clicked: submenu itemMost paths Includes the path to selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry has been clicked. in order to add an own entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script addcustomer.Item (submenu itemplate).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends and Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleaning operations, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks's script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with amarokscript exhaustion. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it at www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & quot; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus. maybe you're looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible during a piece change, that the playlists window will pop up / down to always keep the running piece in the visible window range.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changes to the context browser automatically change the context browser as soon as the next piece is piped.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; using proprietary fonts, the otherwise grey shown section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following range: playlists windows, player windows and context browsers. press Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of user-defined color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playing at the start means that & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is enabled, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the shadow box shadows causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">You can use your own colors to customize the OSD colors for script and background. click on the color areas to open the color selector dialog. if you do not use your own colors, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text box displays the text displayed in the OSD. by typing placeholders the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for xinama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear on.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still enable further adjustments in this card map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set all settings for your collection, including the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting as with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected as well as their subfolders will be searched by music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: make sure & Amarok; add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlists browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The installment database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation in the subwindow MySql is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql Device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: will enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. after that the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card card last.fm establishes support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting enables it & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting & Amarok; a list of similar interpreters to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as OSD, presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will get an error in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. after that, you can delete the file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and restore the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that Taglib is crashing from this file when reading the meta-information. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; it is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate it autom. disable if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens during a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0] not" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib [0]); my $v2tag = $mp3s [0]\ "unless $mp3s &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bug in KDE 3.4.0. this can sometimes be resolved in the Control Center under the Appearance of the Advanced. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: Undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. you can use ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any existing Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also help other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC at irc.freenode.net in the Channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter only one error if you have something in fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appears. how do you get there now?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the start subwindow has been converted to the statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate chunks, the playlist has to be shown in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1269">None! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses one from the backend independent approach, so the actual question must be: which types of media supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we can even decode text and PNG!</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you might need to give a different sink (e.g. bulky).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to hear a white noise. streamer is the best choice for most people if you want to have a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. streamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Either use the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server operated with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE Multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffers in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamy the visualizations react. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. follow these steps to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (end Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run Disk, once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlists window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a runway display showing the current piece or the current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sampling rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the current text display. you can switch through the available analyzers by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the Player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist by & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that it does not exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows different information about the current piece. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will be explained in detail later. they provide information about the current play to each different aspect.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow is off. the information presented there is now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the current piece as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. the title contains the name of the album, the artist and the album. below, you can see the album's cover picture and a MusicBrainz symbol next to it. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded into ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the suggested pieces there are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the performer, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try and download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics text. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are left out of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and below is a further split according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - Album - Sorted to Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works as well as the above, but is additionally sorted by album underneath the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and match the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-track your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection box that lets you filter the last added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. of course, you can also select your total collection so that the filter is virtually switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This clears the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in the queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the section on Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This will make the selected pieces sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the Dialog box for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more items.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trashers... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up synopsis - Changes the album marked as a compilation to a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be displayed under various interpreters, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists quite simple. among other things, he also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the Playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are also possible. click Add Smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, before starting & Amarok; if & Amarok; start, find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer chunks to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this way, the pieces are uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, finish & Amarok; and loosen the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar that lets you get music from a given URL. if you enter for example: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down. in this case, holding the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter characters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter, for example, two three, search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between search terms, search for entries containing either one or the other keyword. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found which contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this search for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries. the entries will then receive a labeling with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist. right next to it, you will find playlist, empty playlist and mating.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the tool bar is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted by a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get right mouse button in the player window. using this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback roles and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse double in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu. using this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Clicking on this entry will open the Visualization Plugin. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>

<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been changed and not yet saved, ask & k3b; after what is to happen. you can then discard between saving and changes. furthermore, you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project what should happen with it, just as if you had called for each project file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and terminates & k3b;. for each project not stored you will be asked what to do with it, as if you had called file Close.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the "Burn" dialog for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional firing pressed, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described by what is the? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you put files for a multiple session CD. this is useful for you, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already available on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove any files from the medium, it only covers the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copy dialog. this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copy dialog. this allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of copying DVD using the copy dialog. therefore, the target medium has to be large enough to capture the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R (W), so that the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the write modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (mink * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, therefore you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">If a previously created DVD image is burning, the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously read-out DVD-Video can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read-out video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is presented in the table of contents and contains the properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its content is displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The contents view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the system administrator password (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first exit. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which of the included programs give you the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions that all & kde; -program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createwigProject () DCOPRef creatMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void () void bournCdImage () void bournDvdImage (URL url) void bournDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can get a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void CreateFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrls (KURL:: list urls, QString path) void reameItem (QString path, QString newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT padateFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder fo</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio.sys; is an audio CD; -Reader for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio.sys; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoders that coding these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) are currently supported. more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders need to be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as mentioned earlier, & kaudio.sys; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not provided to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not cover the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid purchasing copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done only once (but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily approach to reading a & CD is explained. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, with everything being manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request of the CD data starts with the setup of request in the CDDB file tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings in the setup guide - coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection with a different encoder can be read as the default. it is important to note that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog box to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, Piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminating).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog from & kaudio.sys; with different card cards (like encoder, to set up the encoder). here you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes tone quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG mag today has an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bit rates), but compared with OGG, slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset media '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. still needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all songs of a song. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and auto stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudio.sys; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudio.sys may be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiofiles; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; however, no one can prevent you from being inflicted by the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can anyway be obtained from a bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio.sys; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than those used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio.sys may be set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or (usually issued monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to record pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-out WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; please check the sleeve of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something inside it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudio.sys; something that is probably just done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to proceed to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read-out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb to download the CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reader program to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The board map General Settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as animated / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, becomes a & CD; record is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database first. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set it all the way it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work first.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but as many firewalls are using the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous songs: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to discard the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom Folder for Temporary Files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not crossed, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see it all.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting amount of compression is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can be deleted if necessary; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded simultaneously: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can attempt to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiofiles; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is established, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read-out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually insert data instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this hasn't happened yet, then the & CD has to be pushed into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, go to the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully retrieved from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there is a window appears and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input title 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below can be used for each comment inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you do not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio.sys. this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>

<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we don't give the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece will definitely and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. just make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you start selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly beneath the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. with low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiling from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls a lot of different programs has many different options. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screen shots of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke Player by & kde;. besides others it has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real time recording of texts also some features that other & UNIX and MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & quot; support. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. alsa is included as soon as it supports a Sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the used procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish off; while playing a song, kmid will start again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window to the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it onto the & kmid; window. (in several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played back after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the left and right of the template and so change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can specify what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song so that you do not have to manually set the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select the entries for text events and / or recumbent events from the Settings menu. the same function also includes keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in turn after. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. remember, if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song using the Add button. it will again appear the file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using file Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when a piece is opened. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select Next song, next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous piece button, record Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change Patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Change Patch to Trumpet type and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI's patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation mark is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and don't omit any line for one of the 128 tools.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-keysTo M is needed to put all tones that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a firing signal (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. add the following to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should now play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one where the sound equals the pitch of the always identical drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as is its presence. thus, you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussions channel. take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards who have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is pictured on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the key map with the name name for this channel will need to be defined. if you use the ForcePatch option, all occurrences will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the Percussions patch on the Percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-ending event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch bend event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two tones up to one octave up. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find them in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't turn green anymore but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (until now) two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">For example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore, & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable auto-adding to the collection previously. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default speed you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open on a & quot; Desktop, & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file). in this way, I have to switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so, set Automatic Adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I encourage you to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am studying for my hobbies but I try to take some time. as Hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, doing music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won money from anyone. I would like to emphasize that I'm just talking to programmiere because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same if you are using an FM radio device or an AWE-card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you will need to compile & kmid; with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYMEUAL parameter, it works as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save Favorites from the Favorites menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Definitive Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchical level. if you balance an entry, its group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; the various files in directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer can be selected from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose playlists from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode or selecting another group without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the ease of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / sol.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation but the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "inState / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet; & lt; / smilgt; In directory tests / some examples of SMIL; supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as setting the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always use a predefined backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked, the device and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this is dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introvert, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1741">QT;: & Qt; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. Unix-like systems are likely to be used on the package & texlive; resp. & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the & Linux; distribution. for installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; -project contains some pre-compiled packages from & kile; for different distributions. they enable easy installation without further compiling and are included on the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users do not have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If questions arise, or when compiling from & kile; on or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed at the kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this one easy, direct and customized access to all & latex; -programs. in conclusion, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; -reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate, the manual should be used for Kate. users of & kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original and tex; difficult to use, a layman (engl. lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it is derived from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to do so. to be able to master good books, good books should be e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafor.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages, and latex; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the instruction\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Quick entry wizard by & kile; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some options for creating the document. it can also be done some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document Classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], Letter [letter], Report [scrreprt], Report (DIN) [scrreprt], Buch (DIN) [scrreprt], Projector [Beamer], Foil [prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this sets the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as default. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packs for & latex; for inclusion, they only have to be balanced in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now have no need to worry. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as unsuitable). by & kile, it is most likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed. however, you will see it spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you time and trouble.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & kile, an empty line (e.g.\\ end {command}) will be created automatically when entering a new command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be blocked in the menu settings... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subdivided the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files the knitting search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [device dependent file)] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output types of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the mouse button, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the exact opposite is given. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text has been clicked, the corresponding point is skipped in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. a master document simplifies work with others .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set up project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File protection: in this mode, the DVI; file is on the nderungen." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the fast construction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be located. the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; instructions for division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Other is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified designation (choice of a select field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary input is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are required corresponding editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã © e is used for setting the characters. it can be specified in the font settings for the main text, the joins notes, etc., the following typefaces are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two options are available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the fast construction button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & kile; automatically expires storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document is missing, it should be looked for in the logging after the errors. if you use quick construction should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different typeface. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the change of the characters within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only made within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limitation (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to increase legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, you can add specific fonts, bold, crank, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the sivity and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set may be italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; sign language was presented, follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. this should be a quotation, a few places in fat and italics, and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl-E can be converted back to the editor (in the internal viewer). in an external viewer, the window needs to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of the document are useful (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection procedure allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex; -Binary files. for this, only modern under Settings Kile must be set up... Tools Building mature.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection, the mouse pointer must be clicked in a line of the source code and then clicked on preface search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; open and skipped to the corresponding line. to do this, & kile; in & Popular; as text editor (Setup eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the quick build of the & DVI; viewer, there may be an error. if there is an error, it will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file causes the source code error source. the editor can then use the LaTeX errors and latest LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error in the log file must be clicked and & kile; jump to erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Basic users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting a file template...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings generally set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSIPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSICTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and making many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly in menu tools.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate. and to learn about his options, the Kate manual should be used. users of & kile can start reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called from the LaTeX reference help. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with a drilled Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that when clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\ par\\ par\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a right mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with drilled shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source code and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional springmarks. this is an own kind of bookmark within the text. the menu Edit springmarks or the corresponding key root make the jump to the next or last springmark. this is also highlighted in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main features when using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent options added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code added. & latex; use special commands for their selection. under Edit Select, the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">This includes a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & kile; is that the setting is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also includes & latex; -commands with a knitted area (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key root Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, offers & kile; for more commands under Edit Surroundings for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is in front or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, sprayed at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the last opened environment so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by staples {...}. under Edit TeX Group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded closing clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the fenced bracket of a & tex; group # is moved to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups clamps quickly the view over can be lost. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two easy-to-use signs are used as a tag. the sign "for two easy alignment is used. also for the end of the request the sign" is used. & kile; knows this case and has two closing label marks for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double check mark can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in all languages (e.g. ngerman or french) and therewith German or French trademarks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, Enter & kile; a smart line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, the current line is complete with\\\\ with a complete line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be cile under Settings... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in table environments and thereby order all Et characters (amp;) among each other. if this tab is not the necessary tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not the necessary tabulator, add & kile; add some space for the columns position of the current table.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code complete, this was added in & kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic execution. all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings Kile... can be adjusted to complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} will be & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and, possibly, the complete list becomes the complete list. on the other hand, the list may shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed by selecting a command. alternatively, von & kile can be set, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; set up... in a hurry; settings can be made to these lists. various WÃ ¶ rterists can be selected for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rter of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the complete execution of environments. it must always be entered a few letters with\\ begin and the execution mode will result in a great list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used as often that & kile; a special mode for the complete realization of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-completion mode over the menu Edit menu or the key root Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is complete, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings kile; set up... kile; settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterliste des complete indexing mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; support custom lists of defaults, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Mile will be executed fully. as an example of a check list, the file is example.cwl, for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word defended from the menu Modified Abbreviation or the key root Ctrl + Alt Empty, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great books are not helpful for automatic complete completion. however, it has been established that many users in a document are written more than once. thus, it offers & kile; the complete satisfaction for all already written Ã ¶ rter.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings section... Mile can be disabled completely. here, too, the threshold for displaying complete details can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The full-volume files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (shortcut), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog creates the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and reclassifications of pages. if the PDF output is enabled, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To review the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the menu Creating, Creating Converting and Creating View.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers such as & Popular; or the further conversion, the key root Alt; 2 can be used. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being asked about the project New Project.... This is where the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function from & kile; allows execution of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be added in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods has:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly well-developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different aid to support the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & Texlive; delivered with many documents. it contains a documentation for the included packages and another latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete refusal for & tex; and its "friendlyâ consists not only of a description of all programs (but a few important packets are described) but rather a complete instruction manual for the & latex; instructions are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with those & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application of texdoctk, which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package name or impact. by & kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or clicking the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloffered and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor, which can be retrieved on all systems with installed & kde; & kde; is also a part of the Fink project, making & kile; also available on & Mac; with installed OS X.</seg>
<seg id="1869">Many thanks to those who strive for the continuity of the & kile; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under consideration of the & GNU; license. up-to-date information about the contributors is available in the MenÃ ¼ Help Ã "& kile;.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start editing plug-ins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a memory location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pushes the button Setze. the currently selected member (its identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later on, how much someone works on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project leader. see, where such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Typing notes is simple. it can either be selected from the Notatpost from the Editor context menu or the annotation key word in a comment section followed by Notation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where the nickname of the first name of the team member is, the corresponding area or subproject names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the syntax are invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set by Settings Quanta... called. this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including code completion, it can be modified. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal Groß / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attribute: large / lowercase of automatically added attributes. normal / lowercase, the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagnXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Automatically close optional tags: when checked, for tags that the closing tag is optional, this will be inserted immediately after the & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not lock optional tags: as for all other tags, except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update Start- and End-Tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls automatic conversion of accented characters into appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of various types of files. using the Standard button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or other files opened with file opening (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting here will however be offset by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. this setting here is pushed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program, the document can be restored by this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tabby), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings back to default on the next start is useful when the user interface has persisted by modifying the MDI modes and docking / dependency of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of & VPL. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the picture of the parser node in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the frequency of the tree when editing, and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to set abbreviations (a kind of templates) that will be displayed when editing to more extensive text. shortcuts are divided into groups, each one can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause defaults to something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third page, which can be re-used by each part-capable application, the most known and konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in the "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only read-Read-KParts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. it also allows saving the entry, even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin Selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stopping points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (like in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging needs. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger so that it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugger session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is shown in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debit request has begun, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Tells the debugger to start running the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution proceeds. happens before a debit request is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Tells the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two ways, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic links of image buttons (above the editing pane), insert text and instructions quicker into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bar. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but a folder. they only contain the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users may have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using it is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the method method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">This text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that groups the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in dialog once (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any leg breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, verification only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is supposed to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, attainable via DTD Bearbeite DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a new created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = solstice 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>

<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the user-defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with cap, the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but not limited to it), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir directive in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if von & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is attached to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can input from & quantaplus; in the default input field, you can specify what to send to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard output. it can be specified, indicating the output written to the standard output by setting the output selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure action. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called los, stared, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will insert it; startled; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the Text Field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the tool bar to set dialog over Settings toolbar. make sure that the required tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the item to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar would believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by absorbing all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for normal users it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, we will treat the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Section1.html section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html... [Context] Context1.html func2 = func2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = get3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and logically at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used for creating context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context-elements which are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local / global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your doccrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the wasted resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. in different places there is an email-sending item listing, such as sending DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the Scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution, we recommend signing the resources by using a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG-key after your passphrase (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a notification appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary. there is the easiest way to automatically convert DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD File menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Definitionsline: the string that appears in the! doctype tag as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand and to understand full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter seeks to bring these concepts closer to them, without their understanding and quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; use, available. everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all of & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which allows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the cartwheels with information and the toolbars. please check in and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all card traits, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the Editor area lead to a further context menu of the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags located under the mouse cursor, using the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the string under the mouse cursor calls a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as the standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the symbol representing the tag. now, you can insert the data for that particular tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill out different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate through the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with card readers are available for files, project templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be executed using the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of structure in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by right mouse button, further functions are available, such as start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an item opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other tree views. with it, it can change attributes and namespaces. the filing system aligned to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, which can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all the changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed are all error messages (if there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the toolbar's chocolate side is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & quot; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; restricted, is & quantaplus; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; then the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & quot; developer commune. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why does someone else have developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of the program Kommander they can extend & quantaplus; (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, use help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or use khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list is changing every time you open a file that is not on it, but the oldest item will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard there, so that they appear correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard into & URL; -write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables you to select the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Disconnect and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available means of transport depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that will only create the name. actions must be set by setting actions... added. toolbars will be saved through toolbars of toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not remove them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables loading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that has made you or someone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; insertion by tool bar is denied if this tag contradicts the rules at this location.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above menu items. click on them. click an active plug-in to disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available origin schemata depends on the kate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of pointer identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card map mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on / off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars, or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, one unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.ex.com) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows adding files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be linked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the subwindow profile or using Shift; F7 shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcards are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, will be excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the required debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">High loading profiles (see in) can be set up in the profiles subwindow, as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by dragging a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, events can be switched on and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog box opens and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be blocked to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the more unsafe password on the disk storage option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is saved on the disk, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply slipping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project toolbar menu, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own method of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best customizable through the toolbar menu. adding and adding will differ. adding tool bars will be treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where to specify which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbar settings in the menu... and set settings actions.. Set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snips and files to link. & quantaplus; templates generally like a common file system with expandable organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory to the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. imagery with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole web sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As a template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even though it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and dropping or inserting through the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right and select site template in the file tree or in the project file, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very targeted approach. you can type headers and footers, or dynamic with & PHP; design, insert or link files with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as an elter attribute is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is configured in such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like Text-Block. if nothing appears, one probably finds itself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a preceding or displayed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project, and by copying content templates in a folder with custom headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and paste from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reached from the View menu. the first mode replaces the code editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source code editor and the VPL; the cursor is activated in the source code editor and in the VPL; with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, puts the active cursor from one window to the other, and the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Quanta.... When choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties. this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Use of cursor is possible as in text processing, by moving with arrows. in rare circumstances, the cursor acts as an intrinsic character. the marker works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using the button or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, for example, if an anchor day, surrounded with text, must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table wizard or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other programs for style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and execution of style sheets can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see exactly what changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; the merge editor under the differences window allows you to edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; display the exact differences and refer to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and will display it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison or merge of folders will be started. if A file is selected for A, however, for B and C, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then starts immediately. in the Open dialog, you do not have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove nothing from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the row. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. if differences are not so important, the color is displayed. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription Issue:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the Save is disabled!!! (use the Springe keys to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and a black bar appears on the left respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the options or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, side up, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge operation and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture down) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. note that all non-automatically solved conflicts are still considered as conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard content.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved upon exit and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered scanned. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, pressing the Tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer for saving. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Comparing files attempts & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character\\ r 'and a newline\' at the end of a line, while others may be identical in the page-to-page comparison, although they are different. if this option is checked, this option will be disabled, but this option must be disabled during the merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Resolves automatic conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) That is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts resulting from the merge menu. note that the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation. see documentation for directory comparison and merge operation for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file with the suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you have to & kdiff3; exit and restart to make the change active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding, a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define default commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are shown in a color coded hypertext column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply shutdown the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window next to each other or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass it to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut out disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass it to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), the output of the command is used only at the time line. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression that matches all characters in a line. the\\ U converts the found text into uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword /\\\\\ (BAR _ Date\\). *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in feature in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line deviation. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the placements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor is maintained for the display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line balance algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal pre-processor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and display simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (follow more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed by a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the scan, only the files that were compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the folder is scanned, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions to open all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. at folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a file and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a file and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option directories are synchronized active. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; directly copied and cdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge (insecure), then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggest a newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date appears, error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. If such errors are not fixed, the merge of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, a file is processed after the other. it indicates that if the merge operation was successful, and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected appeared. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If full analysis is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or folder), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then C will be used as a destination in the Three-Folder merge mode. B is chosen as a destination in the two-folders merge operation, and A and / or B will be used as the target for syncing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be within the target folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options skipped by the specified entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select start / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merging actions still exist by conflicting file types, a message appears that points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with options Performing, Simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you first want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), leave & kdiff3; you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them together at the later merge of all entries. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern entered, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern entered, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have an extension attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot will mark a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated as normal folders and search recursively. (note that & kdiff3; do not examine possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-sample.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders across a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution with caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarity to the change date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this may be useful, for example, when copying the modification date has been lost. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the sync mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of merging (this is considered unsafe because it assumes that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only merging entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible during merging single files; you can drag the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can disable the default window in the windows menu and switch between the two views using the switch between the directory and the text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be set to sermon and the file will not be merged once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menue: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link identifies a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then it removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the patch program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparisons between two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called Comare) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or let him go like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated first as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as non-identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this will be the sign to this and is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The expense for this was too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src relegated; appeared and the text won't be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To & kdiff3; to compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems while compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries will appear which show differences. this also leads to identical files not being copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after the merge operation. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and ends. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager; then, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimized, maximize, on Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & pager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the name of the virtual desktops will be shown in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty working areas are displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & pager; main window can be determined: classic lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the Control Panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click within & Kpager; and set up switch settings... let the Settings dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. If you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or log in to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign it a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor remains on the same spot for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click prepares pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by the mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer can also be caused by a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you pause the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. thus, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. thus, you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent sliding is turned on, the rotation field is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before it releases the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can make & kde; to shorten the response time. to do so, open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the rider Generel. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at every start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last press of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best of all, use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you have then used to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to decrease & kde response times if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not contain a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is ruckling, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse globe.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. but it should be quick to see if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the reels. they are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by letting the mouse button exit.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a click of a mouse. this makes the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, you can't cause accidental moving of mouse & eg; secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably cause you some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move when you just start & kmousetool; use it as follows: at the end of the text area, press a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, each time, when & kmousetool, the mouse button pressed down a sound like a mouse click. thus, you know exactly when the shift time begins with smart move. later, you can also use the smart move without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension must be installed for & X Window; this should already be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button once the mouse cursor is shortly persisted. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a certain time that a pulling action starts before the mouse button is released. this way, dragging and dropping can be done using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktat; filter is not required for normal work.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before being sent to the speech-speech handler. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and narrator or to circumvent certain flaws of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-patcher" works with a text. & ktats; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the reserved orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is excessively reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you want to read a long text on a web page, you can be greeted with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you initiate from the map file is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & on; just such a pre-reading, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters available.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions. it is delivered with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for the re-formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & XHTML; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktats; for example, if you have set a female voice on the speaker map for example, you can read KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notifications to & ktats; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters installed. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in turn from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the next setting dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Create column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 shows, you may just enter copying.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions with one entry in the box Use Diesen Filters if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separator (space) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & quot; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs or edit it as help to assemble these phrases.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; Converters translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such renditions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The Speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card card, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that the texts should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & on; a text is passed to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the spokesperson properties that the program sends, which sends the text to & ktats; the speaker is selected and the narrator is selected by the Speaker selection filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it with a click on the button to get help in entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To get a faster processing you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click on the right-hand button to view the Speaker Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your favorite settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box Diesen Filters if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above mentioned languages may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the website of ktats;, according to information that is not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-dispenser" program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesis. if you want to expand the use of another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; but it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, compile, you need a current KDE development environment (version 3.4 or later), including the kdelibs packages and the development files for the program "speech-dispenser."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktats; source code for kdeaccessibility or downloaded the Tarball that is up-to-date, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before reading & ktats, check first whether it works properly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktats; the kttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the set-up of speech-dispensers is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sets. the user can return sentence or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktats, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise automatically the appropriate speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktats; select a speaker, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Speaker on the map file, and thus insert a speaker into the list, or click Edit, the card menu Speaker setup will be displayed. as an example, the module setup for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices, which are known, this setting is done automatically. generally speaking, western languages are ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">Use these sliders to adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controllers and displayed this grey, the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multisyn voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KVSD, so that the first set will be synthesized faster (with larger memory usage).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click on Apply to apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the kttsmgr program window will appear at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the symbol kttsmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and kttsmgr does not run yet, it will appear in the system pane once KVSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all contracts are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently processed proposition. the spokesman ID corresponds to the ID column on the card card Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With buttons in this series, you can proceed or go back or backward in the order selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK, all changes of the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be resized to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2703">This card card allows you to set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktats; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the reserved orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is excessively reserved. a warning stops the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you need & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can at & kmouth; nonetheless greet someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the expenditure of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read the Notify messages, start kttsmgr and click notifications. the card notification will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to turn on & quot; notifications. if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and & ctts; read no notifications.</seg>

<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker. default chooses the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the card card speaker as the topmost entry.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as a last option, the action will come to fruition, which was specified under standard (all other events).</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. furthermore, trademarks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the speed or key settings in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limit detection filters (SDB filters). this allows you to start reading faster by reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the entire text order. this allows you to skip or stop orders in pairs, even if the Voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional filters. at the first start of & ktat, a set-level detection filter will be set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further set-level detection filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is by selecting it. switch on the box selection and enter text to read. change the language selection, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then start reading faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the map map, even if the Voice synthesizer fails to support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement recognition filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for typing and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulators are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default password recognition filter maintains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal rate recognition filter out of sight, you can paste it again by loading the included file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the application settings for the application on the Speaker Selection Card. the map will be shown if</seg>

<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired language by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, you do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a prime feature. you will seldom use this property. the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies before, if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the area of speakers, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get a trace.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before reading & ktats, check first if your voice synthesis is working properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. in many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktats.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes the festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / russian /. if you set up the Russian votes, you must enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then the festival takes on lexical analysis and MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates these diphone. txt2pho can also produce diphone. txt2pho can also produce diphone from german lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use & MBROLA; -voices for speech synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in & MBROLA; -folders, but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be invoked by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter will be displayed; the network network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded if the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the selection will be offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the Releasinet. by selecting the setting of non-re-questioning, the setting can be made permanently. then the selection will be set automatically at the next start of the network settings.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. by clicking the button system management mode, you get to the right bottom of the module by clicking the button. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode all the functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface can be used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed in the network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... set up in the Device Dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual selection, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without dhcp or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field of the netmask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. turn on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be turned on or off as required. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows an easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS records can be re-ordered by selecting a entry and bouncing or downgrading in the list with the buttons Rewards or Excel.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button Add... a DNS server can be added from the group machine to name resolution. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to the name resolution, select an entry and then click Edit.... It will be displayed in the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of name-known calculators describes the hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains some known calculators some entries that support and apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test is supposed to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add the Add new alias.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button repeatedly and enter the alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit the machine will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings that are made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The website of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface tool such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section, all of the & knetworkconf and configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to go through in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to assign. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the point of contact, which has a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, IP addresses are usually used in 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is mostly set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for the IP-forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so that it won't be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the Scripts in SuSE. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife put: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be connected by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the tape back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. detects & kdat; you don't know the pre-spell on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detect & kdat; pre-spell, search for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; passes through a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a Tape from & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can be used to save data. if your tape drive requires a format to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can format a tape before use. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity goes & kdat; with the format of the tape. all the data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Backup menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the Backup function will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan process has started, the dialog box dialog appears. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the review settings, the dialog box will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the Restore dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the index file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can add the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the newly selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only those files located in the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders located on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to ascertain the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files have not yet been fully implemented at the time creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is included, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to lock the ejection during tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option on floppy streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; change the hardware file size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to tell & kdat; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; formatting a band, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, enables & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, use & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol-lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open. if you do not see it, and it opens instead of it a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the log files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the Filter Panel to filter after a selected criterion or after typed strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the Filter search term will then only match the entries in the corresponding column. for example, select the process column in the protocol file, and enter the name of a process in the Filter Panel, so you will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the level indicator. the color display of protocol-lines can be turned off the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the FilterPanel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu Window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find further up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder des & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to system V Init without a reinstallation and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first on / etc after a init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or changing to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail; on the other hand, system services do not include such things as setserial, which only starts once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial port in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find out that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then get it repaired by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server -run level running just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. thus, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens when they extract an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you drag them into a new domain. to merely copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the various workspaces (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to change the properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are retrieved from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be okay).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. & ksysv's authors plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are present, which are required by the system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without message if their configuration files are not present or set up incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter Customization of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the save entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card map will be created on which you can make individual settings. further flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card menu appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if for at least one embedded file system space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with space limitation using the File System field.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Card Map Groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System Manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
