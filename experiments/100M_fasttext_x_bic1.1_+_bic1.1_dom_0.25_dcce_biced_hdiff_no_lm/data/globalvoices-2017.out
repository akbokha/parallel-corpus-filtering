although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , discovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensi@@ fied my admi@@ ration for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague has put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in flocks .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply religious person with whom I could enter@@ tain myself about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ ump@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
Tr@@ ump@@ ump In@@ tolerance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who had strug@@ gled for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nominated rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ ided over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump sel@@ ectors as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
could it be that those vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m. d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; Wh@@ ites the Wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; pu@@ n game from white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the big Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white American promise of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
will Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell was sent a message to him .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through g@@ arbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of Cat@@ ech@@ a have in common ?
that the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of gangs .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ limmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day after day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ .000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which have been produced from tr@@ ash .
the repertoire encomp@@ asses classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in g@@ arbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic g@@ arbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
country @-@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspi@@ rational play of g@@ arbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it searched for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were up@@ set accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legal break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ores , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles spe@@ edi@@ ly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to send one of their ports and refused to send him a fishing permit .
&quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do , &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior def@@ end@@ ant of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at the time .
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime ministers had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , IU@@ U fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ pace , with the information between individual countries , the actions today happen in real time , with track@@ able on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads the caught fish on the move to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating boats have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly even if they have a criminal case .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues that are losing eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region is attra@@ cting commercial fishing from all over the world . these are also illegal fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You do not port my port &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i now .
to date , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found volati@@ le ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be loc@@ alised by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system linking different levels of information . it should help FISH @-@ i find criminal agile ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships which were formerly f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected to have consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i have meanwhile risen a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after the FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing nets whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state of Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used to@@ wing networks , which are now prohibited .
the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden water bodies reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes negoti@@ ated the political and economic crisis of the country , re@@ acted by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the backing of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ den@@ regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the discharge of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , Parti@@ cip@@ ant at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the Government Committee :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching deficiency of food and medicine , the referendum on the country is the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were united , called for the trial against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; moreover , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were to continue to block the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Fri@@ days National Civil War , and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re @-@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cri@@ es this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter there are pictures that tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skirts because you could see something else that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round that covers the amount of oppression per day :
this is how the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs to :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , in their view , under@@ took little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis and preferred to stop critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ official . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
Archive recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the magnitude of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself .
from the Sports Hall to the Military Support Point
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who did mar@@ tial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve joined one of the ERP environments .
just be careful not to kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and then I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had raised me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
all of them were stolen .
he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were depos@@ ited and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I saw in and saw a Lie@@ ge , which people were tort@@ ured .
she looked like a b@@ oul@@ der and metal feathers .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was lying there .
they tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ flo@@ wed him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were buried .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people stopped quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told them at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero has struck and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survi@@ vors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , sentenced the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fest@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path that you entered here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apped came .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and were then tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be moved .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at that age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that boot@@ y was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe a military sign that was taken against an enemy that was fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... it is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have fallen into a house and steal everything there .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill yourself .
for that we need no one else !
this was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover from wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but nevertheless he brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can impose a burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last horri@@ ble act &apos;
now , when I &apos;m older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ n@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have put them in j@@ ail .
I guess it was just decided to kill those people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last horri@@ ble act that one can do to a person .
my father told me when the democracy was rein@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed , they brought machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ g@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience on account of him .
then suddenly he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they suppos@@ edly def@@ ended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Now then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 I reported the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was accused of 4@@ 16 criminal off@@ ences , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims , committed between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in 9 cases imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ anti @-@ terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human minds .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked on justice for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country to which La Per@@ la was located in order to establish a memorial , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
revision of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence have been witness@@ ing a particularly mis@@ fortune in the last month .
on a sign the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ on@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; was mistakenly - but perhaps also with malicious background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in many ways in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , published in the Kyoto @-@ based newspaper , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and simply un@@ acceptable in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was removed first . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper , alb@@ eit gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told me about the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt off@@ ended by inadequate correction ( translation ) from our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out somewhat more extensively with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , is quite a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors , which equ@@ ates to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the un@@ named rep@@ orter published comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese are apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language who could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , nevertheless make translations available in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases developed by machine translation show that this technique cannot yet replace a human translator . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
hopefully , the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship activities on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7th April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels included recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cro@@ pped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet sites are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the T@@ elec@@ oms Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I logged in to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website on which the National Assembly delegates its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server answers fla@@ wed or ref@@ uses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday 6 April when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who transferred the protests live in Car@@ ac@@ as , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access multimedia reporting about the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ p@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies from other cri@@ st@@ agers who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of structural .
the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ mean tas , Paraguay is called the 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money survi@@ ves their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do house@@ work for inn@@ um@@ erable days that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this in the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls - especially young girls - were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ tici@@ zes the cri@@ m@@ son guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family who gives her daughter in the belief that she can complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn &apos;t get any education and might even be star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mal@@ treated , his family will only experience it many years later .
sometimes they never even know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín used to go to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member of Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ woh@@ ner@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra joined Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ p@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were pro@@ found@@ ly responsible for Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there could be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the Daily Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as labor force ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ah , where her father worked , had to declare bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all work and started selling swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in her employer &apos;s home between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that she was still time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she returned home and had time to learn .
the sooner she was finished with learning the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t eat in@@ definitely . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles from the opposition papers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the official media reports about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he was intelligent , but did not behave with her . &quot; the master had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; learn poor habits &quot; there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak back home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose again the education they had made possible for them .
she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for all that she received from them with their hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ m@@ urs are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children &apos;s parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ st@@ on@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I did not have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; said Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertis@@ ements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a five year old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work is written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors of the ad switched on again :
dear friends , I &apos;ve found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I am writing again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from Paraguay ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani , and the system of the Men@@ ù ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill proposes social media to Egyptian users to register with the government

released under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian Parliament representatives recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations concerning the Use and Use of Social Networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up which is tas@@ ked with gran@@ ting citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their names and ID numbers on the site of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , social media defines as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and sponsor of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users of the telecommunications ministry received a user name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to this , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to be able to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , declared Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as much as they are for@@ ci@@ bly physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a law@@ suit .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy , MP , proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment was intended for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest against protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq war
one of the rare Persian le@@ op@@ ards .

this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published here as part of an agreement to content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in nor@@ the@@ astern Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining carni@@ v@@ ore in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem . &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem depends also on the fact that a big carni@@ v@@ ore is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera hall , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to protecting protected areas for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , which is responsible for nor@@ the@@ astern Japan , has documented the progress being made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , experiencing both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
even more , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned altern@@ ate houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ fec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the closing light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , it is still possible to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated residential houses to final replacement buildings , even six years after the catastrophe .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 8@@ 0,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who ble@@ w after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune had opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have suffered large areas in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of devast@@ ated land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is lag@@ ging far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to find their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she ques@@ tioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how their perception has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that there was still not enough in the case of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement buildings .
as of 2017 , there are still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that it connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how love for music exc@@ used her aff@@ ection for the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana Mac@@ ias speaks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in country @-@ wide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ az@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of G@@ oi@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ ás admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in G@@ oi@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from G@@ oi@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net , where one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes but fil@@ med from a different perspective is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) in order to cover some of the costs of medical treatment and enable his family to stay at G@@ oi@@ ana while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further attacks against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás :
G@@ oi@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occ@@ up@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group were sabot@@ aged , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stroke .
police attacks
G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where , last Friday , brutal police operation against demonstr@@ ators came .
police officers used protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announ@@ cements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media obsc@@ ured street protests by direc@@ ting the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de São Paulo cli@@ cked on a broken glass window to create illu@@ stra@@ tively with a photo of their pages .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fl@@ ared bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report about a broken window pane rather than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
one must also recognize this if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate , and the typical violent acts of the military police are obsc@@ ured by the head@@ lines entitled &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the villages of Cuba , forgotten by the de@@ priv@@ ation
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ y@@ nos@@ o hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ otte , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after laying down the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to rein@@ vent themselves .
some changed the work .
others resig@@ ned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still ad@@ mon@@ ish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bee , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long idle time are in operation again because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry was already resist@@ ing pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
production in 2016 amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked at even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar rise in the world market .
however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate about $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the Lav@@ ander@@ o sugar factory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all those ques@@ tioned are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first leap year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially written documents which differ@@ ed only in terms of the parts which would be removed from the add@@ res@@ see and date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve of any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factory , which was still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , owned by Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work sheet gro@@ wers has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .

after two years the folk church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to reck@@ on them , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without jobs in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , the production of which serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remain impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a subordin@@ ate person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene walks with 65 years in retirement , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

first Nations teenagers use hip @-@ hop to express their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the first Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do it using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cre@@ e communities in Montreal and then together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Star .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions will explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ni@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. federal state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ ech@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to im@@ part the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ung@@ sters don &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our scre@@ am .
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and proceed as our youth
so they can do what they have intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributed and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( bars of return ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u entrance ( &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) is exhibited by every food served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi &apos;s death @-@ dead district , there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into striking mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger performs a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile ri@@ bb@@ ons decorated with plastic rub@@ bers as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ated fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food delivery is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone booth .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ edy .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our newest cell phone booth has the shape of melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes you can watch at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # H@@ ash@@ tag # H@@ ash@@ tag # list@@ ine .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , such as the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
mexican project tells stories of survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the de@@ mis@@ es and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the hist@@ ories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learn with drug trade &quot; ) , which is meant to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime can not only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( English : &quot; how afraid Life Chang@@ ed &quot; ) nar@@ rates these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret gra@@ ves every weekend to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on a single day .
priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and to search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not receive her because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different with it or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants him to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ ffi@@ ckers ) when he &apos;s big . and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they do not move and are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the capital city district : how a family was pill@@ aged with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals exp@@ elled money from their business for month , until they had destroyed not only the business , but also torn apart their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as they do not know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days , I asked myself whether we@@ eping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm , and make &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles of water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood finished .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it ming@@ led with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosecution counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links contains images on which violence is represented .
the fac@@ t@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
official representatives describe a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people looking at the World Cup Championship .
houses burned up and hid cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make up the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of a stolen body resting on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photograph has been viewed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighter Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in the streets and bushes .
there have been reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of Human Rights Watch &apos;s residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite ima@@ gery .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo turned up again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a fl@@ ashing report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could be@@ atings , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which was fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , the President of Burma Th@@ an being said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations who called AF@@ P as their source also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed Th@@ an to this statement , but had not put the picture of the DR Congo in connection with it .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling extend down to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using an &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed m@@ ash of private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ ayed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which can now be tra@@ cked completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false copy of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( aimed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

France , 2015 .
Twitter posts after the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am such as this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sides such as ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ sters that refu@@ te this .

Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et expres@@ sing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ ig@@ rate , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .

this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ an had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture remains in it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am published by the now deleted message site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dung ya@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) .
the DR Congo &apos;s image appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ ated as evidence of the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 ( ret@@ we@@ ated more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the emb@@ assi@@ es associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the emb@@ assy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( in grey ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ - / date stamps exist on Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and spor@@ adi@@ cally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames that go through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence associated with mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that holding back images of ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the worry that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ise emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how for@@ ci@@ ble media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss regarding non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but which actually can be detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ usive way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog called Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. unmistak@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ dic ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ gun language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - bid for your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ven for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rück language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you get war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds &quot; own words from his blog About :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal different thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally involved in the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ ten@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have taken over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud wave .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 secure residence places .
the ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka are regularly providing regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ding wor@@ sens the Den@@ gue fever , warns the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in the flo@@ ods , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants , enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and startups have also been well @-@ vers@@ ed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of safety and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that one cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
so in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts her children to me ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we are calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the near future , we are developing rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and humans , some hold the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others are gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their conception .
they have had to mis@@ lead me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , the ones I don &apos;t fit there , are mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ised .
to be ab@@ used
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in Western perception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as did the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ vised the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ ad@@ fast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries during the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even elect its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; upon the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative we@@ aken Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination in such a deep and er@@ ron@@ eous manner that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot;
of the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narrative tools that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten U.S. Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at the time when Khan re @-@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an unden@@ i@@ able Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing volume by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ hos@@ tility mechanism with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that has manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
due to the stories we tell and because of the way we relate it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than a stranger that tears the head of a woman .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meter of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms and her Arab Ver@@ ses escaped to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother on her mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; as she has been winning a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen capitals , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslims means speaking the prayers which she told me to speak if I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; Empire &quot; , which founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan interven@@ ed with his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family he was not allowed to close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first bom@@ b@@ shell of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ish subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes he traveled into more parts of the world than I ever was preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ born history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy asks the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the heat that I feel when people crowded airports to fight against Muslim Ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to concern myself with my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build structural Islam@@ hos@@ tility on this ambig@@ u@@ ity .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is made up of Muslim regi@@ str@@ atures that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars we have and the bombs that we reject on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell you , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the North@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply advised to ab@@ ori@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous illu@@ sions that we ste@@ ad@@ fast in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video gallery Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ I , Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an unden@@ i@@ able Muslim .
things I left here like a bread crum@@ bling track in my speech .
things that may wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity ex@@ poses may l@@ ur@@ k a story when someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , Kon@@ vers@@ ations take place in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually take in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged , and people will be enth@@ ron@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ question@@ able questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as it did my girl@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the employment we have no President , the chocolate cake is fed , while he is already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .

can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now , in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .

the mass mort@@ ality of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format story t@@ ellers submit their story first in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their presentation make it possible for the audience to listen to it .
they call forth laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ or Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the traditional customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS in order to organize their own story @-@ telling scre@@ enings .
Puerto Rico demands new fixing of state debt from the United States
with the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ orium Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for their debts to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers won &apos;t find themselves falling down with falling pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - does not suffer from a severe financial crisis .
that is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers recognize the work of the missing Syrian designer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo from the Facebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual digital culture conference organised in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; produced books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive Post Research ) .
the book published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free contains a number of ess@@ ays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the true cost is to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice , pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what did we give up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the general public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the sels cultural prototypes were more predictable than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles f@@ use with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to wi@@ pe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural legacy of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this campaign in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
so far , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in j@@ ail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your won@@ dro@@ us eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guar@@ di@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s incar@@ cer@@ ation , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year passed , my soul
during the season
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ an &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tort@@ ured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption , director of prison reloc@@ ated to previous posts
Mos@@ ambi@@ an responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other def@@ end@@ ants because of mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million euros .
the money came from the public funds of the Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company what happened on April 19th .
in accordance with the opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the request , there would be no ob@@ struction for Cam@@ ba@@ za to reg@@ ain its old position as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after its imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent and did not cause any appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had su@@ cked .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inf@@ lict damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely ins@@ ul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks to return mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral accounts was when he affir@@ med vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling his country for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat 10 years and was free .

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der balls .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; all@@ ways &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding denom@@ ination .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not automatically provoke the hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( late b@@ ask ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different responses to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before all the posts that would be suspected of dis@@ semin@@ ating rac@@ ism .
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spi@@ ders ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , using social networks to simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts by telling his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post office did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , ask the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hate within the various communities .
in addition , it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook posts that have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook removes the post containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook became cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to take control of the balancing act @-@ hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have looked better , looked rather on context rather than code concent@@ rating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is close to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that will prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age of 18 is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , said that the state should not interfere unless the age is not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children with 15 had already been married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8,@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing laws on child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
however , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the critics of the children before they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against child marriage was decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle has posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
after it was decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws of child@@ birth had finally been changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member , Lov@@ ell Francis , who is dressed in the ministry of education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took all too much time and unnecessary talk to disgu@@ ise the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ gende says !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society , who openly discussed how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage @-@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the design for the change of the marriage network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were too opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the child marriage is no longer permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who have en@@ listed him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to be calling on his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that will only provoke panic and un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply talk about that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , stub@@ born men facing them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content once more
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series resist the block@@ age .
although many techn@@ ologically advanced Internet users are used to using wra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Wikipedia articles since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) have appeared .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( calcul@@ ator @-@ host connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , however , the content is accessible .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we do everything in sub@@ mitting snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a @-@ Foundation , and it is merely scre@@ en@@ shots and not live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ horror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and collabor@@ ator at Moz@@ illa in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one access@@ es another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ des r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international scene .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to crack the pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know , for he stood by the hand of Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he goes straight away , we see ourselves and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for everyone &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tour@@ istic accommodation .
see some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a spot@@ ted court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative by name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in expos@@ ing practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV / AIDS infected people , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her round of discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they all perpet@@ u@@ ate and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this will be regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked everybody , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only gig@@ gled in front of herself ; another decided to release all pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women up@@ side down : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a group husband was less understanding and the situation started in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead that indicates the marriage status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc @-@ red dot when he was doing it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped to wear it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think that they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we make a trip to each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want women to worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never said so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only supported sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ via @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of dress , mor@@ ality bound up with the sar@@ is and much more , ug@@ gled Roh@@ ini had her own pair of tas ( upper shirts ) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear zinc @-@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothing - are at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman gets home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

scre@@ enshot from the Beat@@ les official YouTube channel .
on 29th June this year the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese spin through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese variables had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka said , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; w@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liver@@ pool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )

the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ aint enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over the Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of marketing , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

bald men are kid@@ n@@ apped and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be targets of attack in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of ab@@ duction of temporary people for organ trading , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed before and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the BBC &apos;s spokes@@ man for Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission conducted by the UN in South Africa to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que , bald men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ amb@@ ican police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious ritu@@ als , has put cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches of gener@@ eric .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I LOVE THE MO@@ UN@@ BI@@ K THAT SI@@ CH is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald heads are hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange as well as the police spokesperson Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald heads :
mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald men .

this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized to the hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( sovereign debt ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ u case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a nar@@ r@@ ator , he considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the stringent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .

however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway is Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about the release of Liberia .
the relationship between China and Norway fell to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon exports to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as stated in an explanation on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him recover . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the emb@@ assy appe@@ aled to the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the call of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tices around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us Law@@ yer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ur@@ ges China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o is receiving all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he is . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out if France will finally accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Labour Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28th , stating that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has ques@@ tioned if New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore cannot compete with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in the face of it , it inevitably seemed un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers , who pre@@ tend to be Democrats , aband@@ ons the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ red corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the co@@ dex .
when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not refer to it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an reveals his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokesperson ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cab@@ inet@@ d , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapur carry their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who has to pay back to our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world un@@ covered and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live now and again in Japan .
depending on which situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the default response : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly in anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distingu@@ ishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to differ from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously often say &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice &apos; .
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ e@@ zy - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; doesn &apos;t have personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau hits the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ody Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling the prec@@ ep@@ ts of his girl@@ friend .
although not explicitly politically , the music video is indirectly referring to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook has been shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular about the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian paragraph 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution granted to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army &apos;s absolute decision making over key national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; change of settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitoring online contents and prosec@@ uting people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict sense of &quot; the Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the law of mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to buy is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in j@@ ail because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by opponents of Put@@ sch during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ish war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ i are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ la@@ ity , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ floor living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ?
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were congreg@@ ational centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which still host one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother prohibited us from taking photos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as livestock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 for each child .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball scre@@ aming .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that cares for in@@ still@@ ness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ein@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink gro@@ oved frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ein@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full @-@ bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Afrika !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some sleep outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , buying them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits to it , since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chi@@ ckens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ at@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ at@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps are going to go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika everything is back full of guests .
in the passages , travellers should consult their phones quietly .
today , a mini@@ bus has arrived and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves lots of pictures in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ ques that she has made a lady , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad@@ ly , while she puts her in a nut@@ shell .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi announced a mobile phone notification calling the district government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is meant to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities didn &apos;t want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and det@@ ri@@ mental channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app , with the filters for min@@ ors , is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while reports on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ or@@ ship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China showed photos from a check@@ point where police officers checked the residents random@@ ly to see if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back to technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the help of an adult .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all governmental branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office for the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi announced a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police until 1 August .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personal rights three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved itself and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both internally and extern@@ ally .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one who has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es out after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke , and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth turns on the axis of the un@@ holy . you realize that you are imprisoned here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five yo@@ ung@@ sters were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts sought after , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that has been mat@@ ured into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
the third night things cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a splendid image filled with my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice back after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear you scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set themselves on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my fool@@ ish@@ ness and vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot;
&quot; his father with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed pro@@ position lies in my nose even today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months .
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I take care of all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with just a single det@@ ain@@ ee and may set me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ orted to an old @-@ fashi@@ oned communication method : to strike a f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell intake was a &quot; first resp@@ onder@@ ant . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells lay in a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness you can &apos;t see any striking facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we &apos;re all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these cro@@ ws , which fell on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from af@@ ar I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the throat ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th har@@ lot of the Quran ) .
&quot; they are here to be ques@@ tioned . &quot;
the secret was thus aired : to protect and prevent state security from us and prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow point of view of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house that is here no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he &apos;s going so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ver and protest against demonstrations that will soon end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I didn &apos;t do anything to make this penalty .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably origin@@ ating from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es weren &apos;t enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a g@@ arbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find favour at all , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity fed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; let him turn to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced themselves to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and according to his own statement he can feel with the people who suffer from the dis@@ astro@@ us consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he h@@ ates a special dis@@ like against the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while pouring in water , Nes@@ café is pouring into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ Cig@@ are in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jord@@ ania feels like a j@@ ail in the open air , especially if one looks at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as drinking in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - in order not to land in j@@ ail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had &quot; just &quot; been canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m ques@@ tioned by the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is likely to be not just rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b delivered traditional gender standards to Lei@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan , leaving the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still more da@@ un@@ ting that Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure is lacking to support women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law for comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman has nothing to do .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in its country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was fed up with politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality have been extensively cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to notice later that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not dis@@ closed to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ its , a poet from the eighth century , who remains in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ was , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing new in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom that the government sanctions attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former government representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically discussed the problems linked to the deep corruption in the country .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a permanent giving and taking . Jordan has led M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and inner@@ most changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , stre@@ aks and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will move on and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of Japan &apos;s three biggest festivals .
these big extravag@@ ant war@@ rior dol@@ ls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the ban@@ anas , drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the Nor@@ theast to force the Indi@@ genous Pe@@ op@@ les of the region to knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ kli@@ fts are just to be seen .
but for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

out@@ ward appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where tra@@ ffi@@ cking and illegal drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the fancy hair@@ styles from famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ex@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school located in El Call@@ ao found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities we offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love with the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ ill@@ us fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declaration of love for gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate aff@@ ection to people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , from the B@@ ogot@@ á and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letter to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but before the Colum@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and around the clock carrying their weapons , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has accust@@ omed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up the ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans had to come together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in B@@ ogot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , write thousands of love letters , but forget those who need much more .
he was planning , he said further , this year to share his love with people who needed urgent attention .
thus the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former F@@ ARC comb@@ at@@ ants who have now found their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and B@@ ogot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the B@@ ogot@@ á Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness , and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ er lives ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL shell designer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty Case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears run over the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him quite firmly and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the death . &quot; I would never have thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already there was war and the F@@ ARC had already been in hiding .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice on the part of the State would affect the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as a monster and even hate me , are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land is alive hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - also those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former comb@@ at@@ ants responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was told that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take arms , ex@@ alt themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ o@@ wa and whose initial publication took place on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , like a sword @-@ sword , has not yet emerged over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that themati@@ sed the ab@@ duction , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured susp@@ icious que@@ er men and imprisoned them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a sure place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen of the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was there to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up at the last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital , I learned that I had two patch holes in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove it was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that all was just a bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to cope with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number sign with a 95 b@@ umper .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still cannot grasp how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equ@@ ation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with a camera , I really need to look at how the person looks to which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed top@@ ical information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an , and he did not shut down a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
in order that I mean , they probably prefer relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are men still gay in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there weren &apos;t so many .
if , then especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to turn to Ka@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are recorded there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but di@@ pped in a pur@@ pos@@ eful way to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there when these people were taken .
up to now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us closer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the law of law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked up ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short loops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never even cur@@ led me a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ kov ma Khar@@ kov . that means &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased me and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television on mor@@ als .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic increased steadily .
OC Media : what is your activity now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ al@@ re@@ ff , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t pay a cent for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I ap@@ plau@@ ded the sort of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as the Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of their mou@@ ths that there are no bo@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ins have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to me to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the spot@@ light on the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ med human rights groups who work in Ah@@ ra@@ z wish to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z town .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab , Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have heard .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ rons who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and made major efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population will only gain little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to deteri@@ or@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi students rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ v@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has recently become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans newly emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ tend to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood outside their hom@@ etown of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i and to be hired , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all feminine in general .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and discrimination on the grounds of gender still moves across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I am suffering twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speaking on skin colour , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with ra@@ cial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men to have the same rights of all skin color ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking , which refer both to the sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being in historical respect .
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book &apos; afri@@ cana wom@@ ien : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing &apos; says that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that affects the black woman .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ski@@ pped , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I desper@@ ately wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who works and works to protect &quot; the rivers , streams and water channels in Iraq , as well as support the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was shot and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities whose stories can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and her tough@@ er fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; The crying women &quot; in order to express their pain of the women &apos;s moral in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ less ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected person .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her exile , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship a little time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the not@@ orious A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez display did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women refund an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities .
contents 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t contain 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , bad implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several statements and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office included 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence among the Peace Cour@@ ts . here too 86 % of the advertis@@ ements of women came .
in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women were said to have been mi@@ stre@@ ated physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded to Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this will come to any woman who will not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as there is no criminal offen@@ se in Paraguay , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days because of violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should repent for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red psych@@ ic violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to conc@@ ede that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
finally , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertis@@ ements with the authorities stayed without a result and even from their relatives , she received no support .
she directed a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ audi@@ ble legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Women &apos;s Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ a ( # Princ@@ eton ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ In@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law is to explain F@@ em@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal act and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ er than is already the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the bill has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , fear@@ ing that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is being lev@@ elled , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had en@@ vis@@ aged the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) tra@@ verse costs that must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply want to refund the ad and obtain a secure housing to impose on the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence can no longer be viewed as something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
we have to report such a long ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered to be normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , sections of the law had been modified , among other things a passage that the partners had called in cases of domestic violence to reconc@@ ile .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great blow .
this article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ less ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected person .
independent media continued to attack Oman one year after the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a year of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned .
Oman has been reig@@ ning since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismis@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , he held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , restri@@ cting public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of the press , restri@@ cting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities systematically re@@ strain peaceful and legitimate human rights activities and prevent citizens , even activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 it was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties binding the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
the report acc@@ uses government officials to put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a decision in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties tie hands to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the dep@@ uty editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any road , including online , was prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one @-@ year ban on occupation was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of $ 5000 was det@@ ained in the amount of $ 5,000 ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the verdi@@ ct was handed down .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released from the Central Pris@@ on on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he will serve his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
in spite of the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottoman government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to rep@@ ay the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which Oman has been viol@@ ated in recent times .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the Iranian authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j without delay and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman may exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ill@@ as .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and protect them peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ ers 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , the research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater part of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre Laboratory at the Center for Research on Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ ren discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ ers RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I am currently star@@ ing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a mach@@ er himself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest already , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the ag@@ grav@@ ating access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines can only make articles available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a rock b@@ oul@@ der would lie in a river around which I must herd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as best as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing in the US and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the sort Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement origin@@ ates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the free Open Source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , briefly referred to as O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders may ob@@ lige others to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &quot; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed &quot; , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty with no seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available , as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always more restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Ques@@ tion of Vis@@ i@@ bility
plants are bred in such a way that they have pur@@ pos@@ efully desired characteristics - of such , by which their taste or color is improved to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders decreases through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse in terms of climate change .
in an email Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property includes other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait for such a long time to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to facilitate their work to farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall Mort@@ on is disturbed by the concept itself to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , whose cultivation requires a mass of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents . either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , knowing that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you have been protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
while the USA seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is rapidly expanding all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to maintain the seed &apos;s traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col works on an open source license which is ultimately a form@@ id@@ able and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken over one by one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits the patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for the scheduled next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . in it , it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed politics and ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest destinations of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still have to lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharp@@ ly cri@@ tici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains bt@@ - despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and constitution by the authorities , which should defend the law , to keep track of the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not yiel@@ ding . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era &apos;s network of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ oring system , became the target of an attack .
Blogger , the provider that is also home to Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video , as the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly revol@@ ving around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself in blocking the government and reflected what this means to him :
to lock blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of si@@ ege ; arrest , attempted murder , invitation to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous will go the way until the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ xis ) , Egyptian authorities locked out 133 web sites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
hip also documented the locking of suppliers through the reloc@@ ation of internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
A@@ fth reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offered started .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

daily newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed reporting on Viol@@ ence in Rio released the editorial on August 16 , &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , which differs from the civil@@ ised standard , and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist declared that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the paper writes on :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 in Brazil , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north east of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio will be at No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia empha@@ sizes , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
in addition to these security policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was also aimed at occup@@ ying a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police unit and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , for several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repression against the poor municipalities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted an article from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people after themselves .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ clear point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police cl@@ ap the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines . a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : revi@@ ved Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , currently around one million Syri@@ ans are currently in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and around the country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these re@@ bel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under si@@ ege , leading to local people being instructed on locally produced or through tun@@ nels and check@@ points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to traditional foods made in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the launch of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it gains more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , use the humanitarian d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are made of plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for victims of the 2017 bran@@ dies
several hundred people were prot@@ esting on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ aging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the wild@@ fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occ@@ ured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injuries .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery alone , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 . October , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this in any way : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building approvals in locations with high fire risk are ques@@ tioned .
an extensive draft reform proposal introduced by the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was filed by local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ row goes on in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
Qu@@ erc@@ us &apos;s environmental organization drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , look like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took its own civilian protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

one night in the fall of 1994 , the Con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say that at the time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ enc@@ eless .
the T@@ ali@@ ban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country , together with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mortar , which were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his living .
at the time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we couldn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities refused asylum , A@@ shar@@ af arrived in Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church distribut@@ ing food to help needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin ratings . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised establishments in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his wicked way of life helped A@@ shar@@ k free himself from these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ th &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxus - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for credits are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 people live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans operated businesses , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims extend far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail outlets and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af concei@@ ves plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop failures on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other people in this way .
citizen report : alle@@ g@@ ations from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in custody for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that en@@ vis@@ ages that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the direction of a penalty .
the Act , which was promoted by sixty @-@ six members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Parliament presented a legislative proposal that would introduce har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the abuse of the president or a high ranking official .
under the law of law enforcement of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years of imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen , who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the dep@@ ortation of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are united , apparent exposure of among other things weapons ownership , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza revealed the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated Tunis@@ ian activists to scann@@ ed documents
may Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated with a plan of action . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , which according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill , which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all illeg@@ ally preserved funds .
the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website poses a light on how the Pres@@ idential plans will look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the nom@@ ination of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on May 9th as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media .
the regulations also specify that the registry will be required with the full re@@ written name .
anal@@ ysts expect this to achieve the elimination of anonymous feedback in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear to now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to sel@@ ectively en@@ force these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land government as the &quot; Organis@@ er of Information Det@@ achment . &quot;
this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law also allows the government to make said services to remove content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these web sites currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block in Turkey after Wikipedia administrator refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications has announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil society outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
