<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, discovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free after Method Man," "" "" "" "I was as if that's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague has put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in flocks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply religious person with whom I could entertain myself about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumpump Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumpump Intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who had struggled for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump selectors as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for trump, because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (m. d. Ü): as much as "Whites the Whites against all other ethnicities"; pun game from white in allusion to the white and whiplash, which means as much as the big Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white American promise of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion, and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Will Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell was sent a message to him.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through garbage</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Flickr-user OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan town of Catecha have in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (musical band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which have been produced from trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Country-fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it searched for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legal breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorores, Mozambique and the Seychelles speedily mobilized against the ship. they refused to send one of their ports and refused to send him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do," recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior defendant of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime ministers had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like minded and work together." "" "" "" "they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, IUU fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-pace, with the information between individual countries, the actions today happen in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively pursues the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads the caught fish on the move to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating boats have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly even if they have a criminal case.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay for punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "" "" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "" "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to regain an estimated $20 million in lost revenues that are losing eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world. these are also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-complete organized control system," says Long. "" "" "" "" in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say 'You do not port my port'. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">To date, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers FISH-i technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be localised by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system linking different levels of information. it should help FISH-i find criminal agile ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which were formerly fished without a license and hardly expected to have consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile risen a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After the FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "says Kiilu." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state of Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship has also penetrated into forbidden water bodies reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing, "" "" "" "" says Bergh. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the dismissal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Released under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes negotiated the political and economic crisis of the country, reacted by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the backing of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas area, in the Andenregions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the discharge of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately, the secrecy of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Participant at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the Government Committee:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching deficiency of food and medicine, the referendum on the country is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups were united, called for the trial against President Nicolás Maduro. "moreover, a 12-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were to continue to block the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Fridays National Civil War, and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="177">Especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean state of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because you could see something else that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round that covers the amount of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">This is how the dictatorship suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieofficial. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the magnitude of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military Support Point</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who did martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers "Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok. for so my father had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Revision of the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence have been witnessing a particularly misfortune in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (koreionsha), which means "older motorists," was mistakenly - but perhaps also with malicious background thoughts & # 8212; translated as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photo by Joshua Levine, which was divided in many ways in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, published in the Kyoto-based newspaper, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto," "" "" "" "Holmes said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was removed first. the term "terrible drivers" ("terrible drivers") was later replaced by the proper, albeit grammatically not quite correct name "elder drivers" ("older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told me about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) from our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set out somewhat more extensively with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terribly" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in accidents across the country, is quite a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents of seniors, which equates to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The unnamed reporter published comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese are apparently against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation error has, among other things, received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language who could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, nevertheless make translations available in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling phrases developed by machine translation show that this technique cannot yet replace a human translator. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. however, by large companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully, the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPY (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7th April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels included recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups resisting the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was cropped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Venezuelan Internet sites are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 when reporting on protests. at that time, the Telecoms Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I logged in to @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website on which the National Assembly delegates its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPY), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server answers flawed or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third-locked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday 6 April when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests live in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates the internet connections: the Venezuelans access multimedia reporting about the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Crimean tas, Paraguay is called the 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money survives their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do housework for innumerable days that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this in the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls - especially young girls - were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that criticizes the crimson guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family who gives her daughter in the belief that she can complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn't get any education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is maltreated, his family will only experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never even know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secrecy in the Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín used to go to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent beatings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military member of Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira joined Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cripadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were profoundly responsible for Criadazgo's death in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there could be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "" "" "" "said Tina Alvarenga." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to unpunished the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - if the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Daily Life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are exploited not only as labor force; they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farah, where her father worked, had to declare bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in her employer's home between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she returned home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was finished with learning the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't eat indefinitely. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles from the opposition papers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the official media reports about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He was intelligent, but did not behave with her. "the master had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would" learn poor habits "there again." they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would speak back home to their native language Guaraní.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose again the education they had made possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was completely clear, however, that she had paid for all that she received from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment that crimurs are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children's parents have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cristonta.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I did not have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">Isolation was the worst of everything, "said Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society approves the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and paediatric girls in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The group's administrator is Pepa Kostianovsky, a councillor in the Asunción district.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I'm looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="484">To learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please contact us.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ñemby wrote that she had a five year old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came out of Ñemby offered her 15 year old niece. "she likes little children and is very pretty," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "" "" "in the third commentary," "" "" "" "a girl from the interior who wants to work is written." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the authors of the ad switched on again:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I've found one. I'll see if it works with her.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you very much, I am writing again if something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The business was completed.</seg>

<seg id="496">(Criaditas, how long?), a collection of testimonies of former Crimean tas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, cuñadazgo (a practice from Paraguay), the Conquistadores, the women of Guarani, and the system of the Menù (where the workers were treated as semi-slaves). therefore, it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="498">The social inequality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register their names and ID numbers on the site of the site in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, social media defines as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and sponsor of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users of the telecommunications ministry received a user name and password "to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>

<seg id="511">But it has not been known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a lawsuit.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold has been published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions. this article is published here as part of an agreement to content sharing.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in northeastern Iraq, the animal conservationist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia are among the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining carnivore in the Kurdish ecosystem." and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big carnivore is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera hall, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza passionately shows another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">It has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to protecting protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, which is responsible for northeastern Japan, has documented the progress being made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "three-fold disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a great prefectures in Japan's Northeast, experiencing both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, Fukushima prefecture has experienced an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned alternate houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima is the closing light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, it is still possible to relocate evacuated residential houses to final replacement buildings, even six years after the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who blew after the disaster were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune had opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have suffered large areas in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of devastated land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism recovered largely, but also here Fukushima is lagging far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to find their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how their perception has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that there was still not enough in the case of catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuated Fukushima evacuated nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23 000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="582">The world is small: our podcast "Into the Deep"</seg>
<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that it connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how love for music excused her affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias speaks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Goiaznia. millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás admitted that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiana with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a media activist from Goiana, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net, where one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards hasten to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also dipped in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus starting at the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 Euro) in order to cover some of the costs of medical treatment and enable his family to stay at Goiana while he is in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police violence. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing was divided several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. release with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado invites further attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group were sabotaged, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where, last Friday, brutal police operation against demonstrators came.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers used protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media obscured street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de São Paulo clicked on a broken glass window to create illustratively with a photo of their pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a flared bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report about a broken window pane rather than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">One must also recognize this if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is absurd, disproportionate, and the typical violent acts of the military police are obscured by the headlines entitled "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages of Cuba, forgotten by the deprivation</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayotte, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After laying down the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still admonish.</seg>
<seg id="633">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "bee, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long idle time are in operation again because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry was already resisting plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">Production in 2016 amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality looked at even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and barely competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate about $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the Lavandero sugar factory." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first leap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents which differed only in terms of the parts which would be removed from the addressee and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve of any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factory, which was still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, owned by Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved with his will in the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the first Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cree communities in Montreal and then together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions will explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnibago in the U.S. federal state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitechkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to impart the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters don't always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our scream.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and proceed as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and author of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contributed and adds the verse in syllable (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, the Shokuhin sanpuru entrance ("plastic models of the dishes") is exhibited by every food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In Kappabashi's death-dead district, there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into striking mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger performs a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile ribbons decorated with plastic rubbers as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerated fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food delivery is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone booth.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comedy.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "there is someone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest cell phone booth has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes you can watch at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag # Hashtag # Hashtag # listine.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the demises and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the histories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learn with drug trade"), which is meant to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (English: "how afraid Life Changed") narrates these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves every weekend to his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew on a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priests: "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and to search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent with it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants him to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he's big. and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified by being" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spared by such tragedies when they do not move and are silent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months extortion in the capital city district: how a family was pillaged with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals expelled money from their business for month, until they had destroyed not only the business, but also torn apart their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as they do not know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I asked myself whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm, and make "chchi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles of water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood finished.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it mingled with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens' Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecution counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factcheck is important in a moment when it comes to raising rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died there.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of a stolen body resting on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph has been viewed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighter Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in the streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There have been reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one stayed behind to count dead bodies," "" "" "" "said one of Human Rights Watch's residents." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite imagery.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo turned up again, when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misconceptions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flashing report published by the United Nations, those who could flee could beatings, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which was falsely claimed in 2012, the President of Burma Than being said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was sweated as evidence of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (retweated more than 9,300 times), but the embassies associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that go through these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence associated with murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are umpteen people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that holding back images of refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the worry that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to empathise empathy (such as this study, which investigated how forcible media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss regarding nonviolent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, but which actually can be detached from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photographs by Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog called Untranslatable (e.g. unmistakable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese acidic) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotgun language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - bid for your parents in recognition of how they have striven for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrück language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you get warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds "own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal different thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words, showing how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="969">How Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade</seg>
<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide catastrophes this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which is normally involved in the end of May, the rivers of Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attenagalu Oya have taken over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud wave.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 secure residence places.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfall started on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka are regularly providing regular updates on the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly flooding worsens the Dengue fever, warns the Children, after further rainfall are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa Bus was in the floods, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the water level of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants, enclosed in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and startups have also been well-versed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams require drones for their operations, please call the number 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For all those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himbutana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The Taxiruf-App PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the Tropenstorm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood relief" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations. these were then sent to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than thousand enquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, in which several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need of safety and provide assistance.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of further human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of normality.</seg>

<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now, but who today made me an undeniable Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left here like a bread crumbling track in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that may wake up memories, as in all the intersections that our humanity exposes may lurk a story when someone is made to a "other."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, Konversations take place in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are waged, and people will be enthroned by creating the "other" in public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves unquestionable questions about the role of being aware and unconsciously the "other"; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women's March because the employment we have no President, the chocolate cake is fed, while he is already broken countries and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Telling stories, by flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now, in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's languages can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while" "" "" "" "listen often to understand" "" "" "" "these events instead" listen to "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format story tellers submit their story first in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation make it possible for the audience to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story teller Rassidator Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the traditional customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" he shares his sense of inclusiveness with a wide grin:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS in order to organize their own story-telling screenings.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico demands new fixing of state debt from the United States</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the goal of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march started at the Puertorium Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for their debts to be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our pensioners won't find themselves falling down with falling pension payments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - does not suffer from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">That is why the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside will be jeopardised without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration bore the name "Night Guard for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1180">Bassel Safadi and his wife Noura.</seg>
<seg id="1181">Photo from the Facebook page of Noura Ghazi Safadi.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual digital culture conference organised in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' produced books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Post Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available royalty-free contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the true cost is to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice, pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the sels cultural prototypes were more predictable than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the sign of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles fuse with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural legacy of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This campaign in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">So far, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book envelope by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It's happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your wondrous eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">That I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's incarceration, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passed, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the season</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bashan's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director of prison relocated to previous posts</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambian responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants because of misappropriation of 54 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of the Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his reinstatement to the company what happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the request, there would be no obstruction for Cambaza to regain its old position as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after its imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not cause any appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had sucked.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks to return morality and to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeuste prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Mosambians, but also as sharp, cutting-edge and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral accounts was when he affirmed vigorously that "an ambitious human being is capable of selling his country for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment; he sat 10 years and was free.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spider balls.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "allways" (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading denomination.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Kalar" may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically provoke the hate speech. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important and # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (late bask), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different responses to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before all the posts that would be suspected of disseminating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook doesn't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spiders).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, using social networks to simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts by telling his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post office did not meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, ask the Burmese Internet Community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hate within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that have no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the post containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, heal people then?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook became criticized for his failure to take control of the balancing act-hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have looked better, looked rather on context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8,400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing laws on child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill against child marriage was decided - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the Attorney-General of Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate, if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>

<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that will only provoke panic and unpleasantness if we, instead of speaking of the problem, would simply talk about that the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, stubborn men facing them, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content once more</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular encyclopedia of Wikipedia, based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically advanced Internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Wikipedia articles since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated) have appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (calculator-host connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, however, the content is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we do everything in submitting snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and not live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiLehorror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and collaborator at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlendes rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Neptune wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate game wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crack the pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he stood by the hand of Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he goes straight away, we see ourselves and he stares at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for everyone" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the touristic accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead they use pronouns or say" father of my child. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian State of Odisha by a spotted court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative by name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the community Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in exposing practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV / AIDS infected people, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her round of discussion was of women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands out loud is a custom that they all perpetuate and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this will be regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everybody, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only giggled in front of herself; another decided to release all pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women upside down: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A group husband was less understanding and the situation started in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead that indicates the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc-red dot when he was doing it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think that they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip to each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I do not want women to worry who what could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never said so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a salvia-curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of dress, morality bound up with the saris and much more, uggled Rohini had her own pair of tas (upper shirts) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear zinc-red on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like violets for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothing - are at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman gets home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On 29th June this year the Hashtag was to be found in the Japanese twitter-trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese spin through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese variables had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka said, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is the Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the familiar places related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quaint enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is the Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan community in terms of marketing, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">Today I will listen to "Yesterday" and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>
<seg id="1579">That is how the day will run today.</seg>
<seg id="1580">So, we hope you're there!</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded before and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>

<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to a mission conducted by the UN in South Africa to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized to the hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (sovereign debt), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "" "" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Liu case as" an internal matter "" "" "" "" and told a narrator, he considered "" "" "" "" not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "while some countries have criticised the stringent treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway is Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about the release of Liberia.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius as stated in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he can help him recover. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy appealed to the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The call of the US embassy drew a furious answer from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and have irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1660">The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope that Liu will receive "all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the top priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortices around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urges China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo is receiving all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he is. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out if France will finally accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Labour Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28th, stating that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "twist logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore cannot compete with other "normal countries," in the face of it, it inevitably seemed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the main point of the topic, the good old lyre from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be Democrats, abandons the twisted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng invites Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is more a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that Singapore" "" "" "" "is not a country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not refer to it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan reveals his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "has Mr Shanmugam committed a mistake" "" "" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesperson?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cabinetd, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors about certain parts of the world uncovered and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I am most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live now and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on which situation the conversation is taking place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification is usually followed by the default response: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly in anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible to their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to differ from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously often say "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you would confuse me with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp 'nice'.</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means to be skezy - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian double-gänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" doesn't have personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often talk about the fence along with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau hits the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parody Thailand's Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling the precepts of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly politically, the music video is indirectly referring to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook has been shared 1,254 times and received 8,800 songs.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular about the position of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may relate to the draconian paragraph 44 of the provisional constitution granted to the commander-in-chief of the Army's absolute decision making over key national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "change of settings" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people considered by the Junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, monitoring online contents and prosecuting people accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict sense of "the Majeste" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the law of martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the junta continues to buy is to buy expensive submarines, although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail because they are supposed to have caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the song showed members of the band that imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by opponents of Putsch during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America certain places for their hospitality are known." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapeinula, it is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink grooved frame and golden earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapeinula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells, people come in full-busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Afrika!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some sleep outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, buying them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he replies with a smile." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I really feel it fits to it, since African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he replies smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants travelling through Tapatula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapatula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps are going to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the passages, travellers should consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Today, a minibus has arrived and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves lots of pictures in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair plaques that she has made a lady, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she puts her in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi announced a mobile phone notification calling the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "" "" "is meant to prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities didn't want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and detrimental channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic sites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the filters for minors, is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on users' experiences in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" the censored news published in China showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers checked the residents randomly to see if they had installed the surveillance app. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback to technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the help of an adult.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office for the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi announced a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police until 1 August.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates Urumquis's personal rights three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1995">Far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything is important.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has gradually dissolved itself and revealed a truth that is clearly identifiable, both internally and externally.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honour to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries out after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubts dissolve in smoke, and you become aware of your existence, even when the Earth turns on the axis of the unholy. you realize that you are imprisoned here between the walls that your parents, and in front of them your grandparents, stone for stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to "learn my lesson," as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five youngsters were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like weeds.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the districts sought after, but my own not.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I didn't put any high demands on a city that has been matured into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">The third night things calmed down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence, screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" out of my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>

<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement and his father."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this accursed proposition lies in my nose even today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a "syndrome," a mental torture I was exposed for months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the yard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I take care of all details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with just a single detainee and may set me immediately without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-fashioned communication method: to strike a fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell intake was a "first responderant."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently, none of the surrounding cells lay in a prominent middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect darkness you can't see any striking facial features, and there are no doctors here; we're all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have had a scarecrow to chase away all these crows, which fell on the fruit in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From afar I still hear them screaming "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the screams are ringing, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the throat (about: "thunder," allusion to the 13th harlot of the Quran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to be questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2055">The secret was thus aired: to protect and prevent state security from us and prevent the traitors and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow point of view of their world view.</seg>

<seg id="2057">I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he's going so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the expressions that derail him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join this Tagediver and protest against demonstrations that will soon end anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I used to get used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, although I didn't do anything to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube, probably originating from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries weren't enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest I asked myself if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and did not find favour at all, which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity fed my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which happened to me as minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; let him turn to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family forced themselves to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyeen (e.g.: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and according to his own statement he can feel with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he hates a special dislike against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation," he describes himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while pouring in water, Nescafé is pouring into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-Cigare in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordania feels like a jail in the open air, especially if one looks at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as drinking in the public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had "just" been canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism questioned by the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be not just rhetoric, but actually reflect a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib delivered traditional gender standards to Leibe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honourable murders' has increased in Jordan, leaving the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still more daunting that Jordan's institutional infrastructure is lacking to support women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of inner-family violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that the woman has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered taboo in its country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was fed up with politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santorano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogen- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been extensively censored until 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to notice later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not disclosed to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuits, a poet from the eighth century, who remains in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwas, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is nothing new in the Hashemite Kingdom that the government sanctions attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former government representatives and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they have critically discussed the problems linked to the deep corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaib believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent giving and taking. Jordan has led Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and innermost changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, streaks and artificially-led democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will move on and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of Japan's three biggest festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the bananas, drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies marched from the west of Japan to the Northeast to force the Indigenous Peoples of the region to knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two forklifts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">But for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outward appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where trafficking and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the fancy hairstyles from famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who can create the most excentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school located in El Callao found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities we offer, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love with the children.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "" "" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "" "" "declaration of love for guerrillacer" "" "" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate affection to people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga, from the Bogotá and Cristian Palacios Foundation from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la Reconciliación (letter to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Columbians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock carrying their weapons, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up the ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians had to come together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, write thousands of love letters, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning, he said further, this year to share his love with people who needed urgent attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former FARC combatants who have now found their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotá Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness, and all that lies in between, "said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillacer lives) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed there was a MGL shell designer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty Case.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Hello, what do you do?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer it. "suddenly the tears run over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this stewardship, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. joining the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the death. "I would never have thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already there was war and the FARC had already been in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State would affect the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as a monster and even hate me, are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land is alive hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - also those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was told that after the disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take arms, exalt themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community, like a sword-sword, has not yet emerged over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legislation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that thematised the abduction, torture and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milashina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queer men and imprisoned them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a sure place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group had experienced Chetschenen of the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life, she moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honour the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital, I learned that I had two patch holes in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you placed - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I didn't change my gender, that all was just a bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to cope with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her:" "" "" "" "they brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number sign with a 95 bumper.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registering without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equation, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I really need to look at how the person looks to which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed topical information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not shut down a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In order that I mean, they probably prefer relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still gay in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there weren't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to turn to Kayrov's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but dipped in a purposeful way to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was there when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they have not been presented as bandits, there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously in earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally intended to bring us closer to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but eventually threw us back to the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the law of law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked up; I had dyed lashes, bore tube jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never even curled me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole town knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharkov ma Kharkov. that means "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased me and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television on morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic increased steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what is your activity now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tealreff, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I applauded the sort of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as the Chechens who want to prophesy with foam in front of their mouths that there are no boils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the Kabardins have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transience to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in self-murder within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestor region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in self-murder.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the spotlight on the desperate situation of the Arab Ahvtsi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, so Ahmed human rights groups who work in Ahraz wish to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz town.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahvtsi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab, Bani Tamim - have heard.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patrons who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahvtsi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab ancestor living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made major efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population will only gain little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahrazi-Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to deteriorating the devastation caused in the region, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi students rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahvzis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Dohimi said that especially unemployment has recently become worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians newly emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not pretend to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahvtsi will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their hometown of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahvtsi and to be hired, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahvtsi have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and discrimination on the grounds of gender still moves across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speaking on skin colour, on black women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men to have the same rights of all skin color; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, which refer both to the sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained: "am I not a woman?" and I too refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a demented and marginalized being in historical respect.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself completely from feminism and join the movement of womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than myself for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book 'africana womien: Reclaiming' says that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that affects the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports inparticular about international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">As part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Again and again Nabil Musa travelled over the past seven years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I desperately wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "" "" "" "Musa tells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who works and works to protect "the rivers, streams and water channels in Iraq, as well as support the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was shot and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weightless), which reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected person.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her exile, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship a little time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, the notorious Ada Báez display did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women refund an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents 1 Strikes and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn't contain 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, bad implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are several statements and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she endured psychic violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to concede that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn't leave him before.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of its reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>

<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been reigning since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, restricting public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrain peaceful and legitimate human rights activities and prevent citizens, even activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in public authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closing and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 it was reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely, after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any road, including online, was prohibited from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the court in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, for disturbance of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "undermining the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars). furthermore, a one-year ban on occupation was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of "an information network to disseminate material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of $5000 was detained in the amount of $5,000 (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the verdict was handed down.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released from the Central Prison on 10 April 2017. al-Haj is still in prison where he will serve his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court to leave Azamn again, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottoman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of Azamn was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the Minister ordered another time against the decision of the Court of Appeal to repay the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren't the only cases in which Oman has been violated in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuing closure of Azamn and the incarceration of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) urges the Iranian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj without delay and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriers 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater part of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre Laboratory at the Center for Research on Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Sambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warren discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>

<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a macher himself.</seg>

<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest already, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the aggravating access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make articles available against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents do not only apply to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a rock boulder would lie in a river around which I must herd." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as best as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing in the US and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Römersalat of the sort Outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the free Open Source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, briefly referred to as OSSI, US breeders may oblige others to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers "rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed", "he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty with no seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available, as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always more restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have purposefully desired characteristics - of such, by which their taste or color is improved to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse in terms of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate their work to farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall Morton is disturbed by the concept itself to patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, whose cultivation requires a mass of herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents. either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, knowing that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, you have been protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the USA seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is rapidly expanding all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed programme. to maintain the seed's traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one by one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits the patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for "open source" seed systems, explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems, which should be scheduled for the scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. in it, it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed politics and ensure a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest destinations of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still have to lock content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains bt- despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and constitution by the authorities, which should defend the law, to keep track of the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not yielding. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's network of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web page lockings to the victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censoring system, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to Ziada's blog, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and taking a video, as the police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly revolving around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself in blocking the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, invitation to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous will go the way until the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Axis), Egyptian authorities locked out 133 web sites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Hip also documented the locking of suppliers through the relocation of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afth reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offered started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army is used by the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via fotos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Daily newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and airwafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra" published for detailed reporting on Violence in Rio released the editorial on August 16, "This is not normal" in which it announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, which differs from the civilised standard, and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a rubric in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist declared that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to the statistics of 2015 in Brazil, is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north east of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio will be at No. 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to the Globo company, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these security policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was also aimed at occupying a Favela by deploying a massive police unit and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, for several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repression against the poor municipalities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted an article from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unclear point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police clap the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines. a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, currently around one million Syrians are currently in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to local people being instructed on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to traditional foods made in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The launch of the project, Abo Nabil, said opposite the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we decided to cultivate fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it gains more and more prominence. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, use the humanitarian dfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the planting of fungi, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are made of plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started with the "production of fungal seeds coming from the regions" before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms all over East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for victims of the 2017 brandies</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protesting on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampaging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the wildfires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery alone, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">In Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this in any way: there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "" "" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building approvals in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">An extensive draft reform proposal introduced by the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was filed by local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case, if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorrow goes on in the same article of the Público newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">Quercus's environmental organization drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of easily inflammable wood, look like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took its own civilian protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial on this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country, together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At the time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we couldn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities refused asylum, Asharaf arrived in Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Ashark was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church distributing food to help needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin ratings. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "" "" "special reception centres." "" "" "" "these are improvised establishments in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his wicked way of life helped Ashark free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Ashark put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Barth's success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxus - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for credits are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, about 20,000 people live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans operated businesses, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims extend far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail outlets and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf conceives plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservative techniques. "so they can sell their crop failures on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other people in this way.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: allegations from Egypt enable shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, in custody for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that envisages that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the direction of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which was promoted by sixty-six members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Parliament presented a legislative proposal that would introduce harsher penalties for the abuse of the president or a high ranking official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law of law enforcement of the president as well as state institutions is already punishable. under the law, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, according to legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years of imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen, who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the deportation of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups are united, apparent exposure of among other things weapons ownership, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza revealed the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting block on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated with a plan of action. said Plan comes from the President of the Republic, which according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill, which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they return all illegally preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the Nawaat website poses a light on how the Presidential plans will look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejects the nomination of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on May 9th as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also specify that the registry will be required with the full rewritten name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts expect this to achieve the elimination of anonymous feedback in conversations within social networks. it is unclear to now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to selectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roscomnadzor WeChat failed to register with the Land government as the "Organiser of Information Detachment."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law dating back to 2014, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the publication of information. the law also allows the government to make said services to remove content and force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web sites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled the Wikipedias block in Turkey after Wikipedia administrator refused to delete two English-language articles, the information, Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications has announced that the site was blocked because it was "an information source that collaborates with groups to address a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civil society outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
