this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he was the New York Times rep@@ orter won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he released spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally dismis@@ sed phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA has literally delivered designs to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has established against risks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and spy on journalists .
according to the First constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous they reveal .
so when the government ki@@ cked off at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous rep@@ orters were already doing before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had been declar@@ ing for years that it was essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and tear@@ ing up the statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his phone secret secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel report with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and Ris@@ en .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has con@@ vic@@ ted more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has become too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today , there are communication software that did not exist yet , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today is enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective message agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the ou@@ tset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to kill offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and to report from crowded hospitals . or the nearest environmental representatives who are aler@@ ting the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; 3 . April 2016 &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister resig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now there will be a lot of Austri@@ ans and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent @-@ saver or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we go ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
around the world media and leading politicians , as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations that have occurred to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , need less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were really sho@@ cked that everyone had suggestions on how to transfer his money to a lawyer from our investig@@ ator .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very d@@ ull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
representatives of both parties brought a bill into parliament in both chambers of parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people to get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are campaig@@ ning to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet selling .
a guy in red Mazda stood and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what d@@ ined me there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I was afraid that I went out of bed , che@@ ering at to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door shut off .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were friends who only waiting to be discovered ?
taking people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let us make a leap of time , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate dra@@ gs and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was at that time a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I considered how we could make something to it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visitors come by .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to fire .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwell@@ ings of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you mind the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your acc@@ ent mobile phone to your left seat .
this silent flight of panic you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores cell phone ?
could you tell me on Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 ass@@ essments , all of them say : &quot; he can really hold on really well @-@ sprung phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decis@@ i@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their ass@@ essments before we put them on line .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence .
it is not surprising that we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through ass@@ essments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation l@@ acks simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much to get away from them .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I am making holidays with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to submit these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been covered beforehand .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have ra@@ v@@ aged homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men put their trust in one another .
if trust works , there can be wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; perfect home for travelers pr@@ one to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one thing right .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions go together ?
it is a matter of economic commerce .
but to call it &quot; rental industry &quot; is not just the case .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would be waiting for a thorough re@@ plen@@ ishment and to show you a district that has never been heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take thought of shared part ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . many car parks that belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy , over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ .000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not rein@@ vent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had such a big impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull ath@@ l@@ ete @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passive the belief of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought , ques@@ tioned , dou@@ b@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people ran out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should you do something like this ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had &quot; ... , ... &quot; bom@@ bing Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only did my country have been attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building studies .
I remember how I ro@@ de -- when we ro@@ de silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islam@@ ist organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Do not go down . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged into the open and beat .
there really were fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have ab@@ ated the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are fu@@ tile because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olymp@@ ians .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be some parking spaces free , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater public participation .
and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radical process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can do a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the fact that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslims , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but when looking at them , they do not imp@@ air what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a prime objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and His church .
instead of bl@@ aming her for anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows that when people submit news reports that have a negative impact on Muslims , they prefer military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms all of us .
in the case of the allocation of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was at the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon .
he fired eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and put off my shoes , and went into the building @-@ hall , and what I saw let me go .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say you don &apos;t fool me . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims all over the world and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want welfare for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air parcel delivery penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the public . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting air@@ planes , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ eving structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and in general react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possibilities in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an air@@ plane trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starter motors , it can ho@@ ver and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a reverse side .
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea is that the air@@ plane doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions , which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices that only had two movable parts : a propeller and a rear @-@ ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or controller surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant rear star@@ ters algorithm . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it out is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in trouble , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is quite symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned , or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive flows of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they have to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ ellers fall out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by fli@@ pping a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , the salary is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed together ever faster in a galax@@ y far away , so they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago several cel@@ i@@ ac life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands with us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed the idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ shaft Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the performance of the co@@ g@@ nition .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the Det@@ ector commen@@ ced , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector as well .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell of my termin@@ ally ill father .
in essence these were the fruits of my life .
all of what I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ ud@@ dle in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other .
instruc@@ tors in courses on rel@@ ativity often lead a really old dance to the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretching and spra@@ ying , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked at the start of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , as you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of killing , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible , to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to relate to the story behind it .
&quot; now is Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound we can literally stop speaking .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the col@@ lision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott occupied himself very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
when the two bodies turn very quickly , one h@@ ears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- no one who knows what to hear is recognis@@ ing this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times sun mass each , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , circle each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way of exploring the universe , as never before .
on this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can not see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the big b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the big b@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that all things exist that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o immediately found things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to say , the sau@@ rian no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected style . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ sti@@ mates &quot; for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you invite me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; word for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m an author . I think things out , bring you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are produced simultaneously .
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days with four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I have created myself , and not only produced , so even in the evening . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , country or class@@ room , take a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ es , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything per@@ spi@@ ration -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as a result , one toler@@ ates a high sound , delivering a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , st@@ ress@@ ful and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with television production when I began to work and work , build , create , and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is music . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is light and air .
the h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums , you cannot strive for size differently .
the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called Gen@@ ie .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more epis@@ odes , the more involved barriers , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz@@ ing . I am the h@@ um .
am I just this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are accust@@ omed to the truth that their mother is a single work stit@@ cher .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ sti@@ mate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , working weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you stupid , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you do , you do , you love what you do , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late on and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I want to say No when two things are aware of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , it did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing is bet@@ r@@ oth@@ ed , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door approaches and an energy shift enters .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as though I know a magic secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titanium um@@ bs , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how function@@ ally my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real h@@ um ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pers to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ a@@ holic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not pretty much like working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this con@@ fession is painful , for what kind of person does better work than to be at home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we race around in the garden , before and forth , back and forth .
we do little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I mostly feel sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cu@@ it replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
everyone can bring it up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes on track !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children ready to bed .
but there are 15 minutes in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s all about joy ,
to play &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz returned in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flo@@ ods in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the h@@ um , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my h@@ um .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the Sum@@ ming of Love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is s@@ no@@ wing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who is going to go to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . the land I create , the marathon , I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the sums of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of being alive within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel that sums , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m an author . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nervous functions by various surgical interventions .
for sure , they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , one im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ates an electro@@ de in the brain to influence the switching circles of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain swell@@ s and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this , one sometimes needs to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells .
you may know from the biology lesson that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why are they left behind us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential source of cells that enables brain healing .
we had to prove it .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to keep them in the brain .
in the last step , we rei@@ gn@@ ited them at the removal point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we strike these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller &apos;s help , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we caused an injury and mat@@ ured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been mat@@ ured .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we in vitro , dy@@ ed in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we last in the mot@@ oric c@@ ort@@ ex the hand motor sector .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to some extent , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like with monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the ape , which recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have discovered a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant it with human beings .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest hin@@ dran@@ ces are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : it &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and have tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an invent@@ or of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changing ma@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great copy@@ cats in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ug@@ ly friends who repeatedly told me that the democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group lie in error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mi@@ tig@@ ated , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to draw attention to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks &quot; parad@@ ox .
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could take off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity needs , for example , green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , England and the euro area , tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
the 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ame the stock prices and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in a continuous loop , boo@@ sts the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus Father , who from fear , the prophecy of the Oracle could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that the body k@@ ills it .
this is my contradiction with capitalism --
all the non @-@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and that it was not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same weigh@@ ting in questions of the public concerns .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
our liberal democra@@ cies , however , do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our modern democra@@ cies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting the policy and dis@@ ma@@ ying it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power has been cut off from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ v@@ ings with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of carni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end they are star@@ ving .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ prov@@ oked economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism drives &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor attain a position only by a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low wages through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste is more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts more deeply , just as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we need to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conqu@@ ests he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used to research the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it need to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in brief , some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and proceeds , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no ex@@ tran@@ eous twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment instruments are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time the liberal , in which it fav@@ ors privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and so I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not mad , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the 19th century England .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .

BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive val@@ or@@ isation line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may perhaps be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he said he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the credi@@ tors &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they simply wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we permit ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of the Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most have never heard of it even though he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is managing employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ gel hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are at the very right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site , which is based on 1 to 10 and shows how many shows receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where after a season has looked , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to supp@@ ress &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium output , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon lays things out for nothing , is it right ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and the answer is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make Sit@@ com via four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- literally -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organising a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 @-@ rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
if you gather millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the minimum you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working this way , this is a little fri@@ ghtening , because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in j@@ ail here in the USA and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dism@@ iss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in j@@ ail are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that by data analysis , they could predi@@ ct out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- by analy@@ zing Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data experienced by experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very wise men can use many data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyse the parts ; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the pieces and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intel@@ lect wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there were data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ encing it later with a technical demonstration .
so far , I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
