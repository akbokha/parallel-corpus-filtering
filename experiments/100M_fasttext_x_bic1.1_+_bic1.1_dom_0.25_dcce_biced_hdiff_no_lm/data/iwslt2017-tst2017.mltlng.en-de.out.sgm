<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he was the New York Times reporter won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he released spectacularly that the NSA has illegally dismissed phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA has literally delivered designs to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has established against risks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning Whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government kicked off at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were already doing before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had been declaring for years that it was essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and tearing up the statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his phone secret secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel report with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has convicted more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has become too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that did not exist yet, as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today is enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly procure information, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have a possibility to kill offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and to report from crowded hospitals. or the nearest environmental representatives who are alerting the polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3. April 2016] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Rich and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens].] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a statement.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like the Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has mail box companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of Austrians and others waiting nervously for the next release and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent-saver or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Around the world media and leading politicians, as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these lines.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what it is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations that have occurred to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, need less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">We were really shocked that everyone had suggestions on how to transfer his money to a lawyer from our investigator.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties brought a bill into parliament in both chambers of parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people to get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are campaigning to end this kind of intransparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in red Mazda stood and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard myself saying," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "one voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Well, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what dined me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I was afraid that I went out of bed, cheering at toes to the door, and my bedroom door shut off.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were friends who only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Taking people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a leap of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate drags and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was at that time a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I considered how we could make something to it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visitors come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwellings of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you mind the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your accent mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't just read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell me on Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined with his name; if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments, all of them say: "he can really hold on really well-sprung phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their assessments before we put them on line.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is not surprising that we trust people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation lacks similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much to get away from them.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, for example, "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is rather not accepted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your home! I am making holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a demand that had not been covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have ravaged homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men put their trust in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one thing right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">But to call it "rental industry" is not just the case.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would be waiting for a thorough replenishment and to show you a district that has never been heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take thought of shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital of Seoul, this project has already begun. many car parks that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy, over our platform alone, 785.000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had such a big impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull athlete-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oute me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head covering.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "" "" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passive the belief of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">After my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people ran out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical failure?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad"...,... "bombing Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only did my country have been attacked, but in Nu the deeds of others turned me into suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start building studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I rode -- when we rode silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamist organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lighted areas," "Do not go down."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings:" "" "" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the open and beat.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really were fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have abated the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are futile because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are the inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces free, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radical process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists can do a brainwashing that leads to the fact that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslims, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when looking at them, they do not impair what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a prime objective for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blaming her for anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that when people submit news reports that have a negative impact on Muslims, they prefer military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of the allocation of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental department, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when did such a young man come from my brother?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal, not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and put off my shoes, and went into the building-hall, and what I saw let me go.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I'd say you don't fool me. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at the Muslims all over the world and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want welfare for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel delivery penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the public. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting airplanes, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-relieving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and in general react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possibilities in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "external commands are available at the highest level. for example," "" "" "" "Start" "" "" "" "and" land "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starter motors, it can hover and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a reverse side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea is that the airplane doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions, which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear-rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or controller surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant rear starters algorithm. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it out is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in trouble, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is quite symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned, or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines are to be part of our everyday life, they have to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propellers fall out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by flipping a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, the salary is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled together ever faster in a galaxy far away, so they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they shone brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago several celiac life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced quite a few things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands with us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which arise through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed the idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-shaft Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the performance of the cognition.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the Detector commenced, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector as well.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my terminally ill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All of what I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cuddle in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Instructors in courses on relativity often lead a really old dance to the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and spraying, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the start of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after comma followed by a 1. that's why one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described by Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, as you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of killing, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible, to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to relate to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now is Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound we can literally stop speaking.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott occupied himself very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">When the two bodies turn very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- no one who knows what to hear is recognising this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times sun mass each, which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 probes, circle each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way of exploring the universe, as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the big bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the big bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo immediately found things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to say, the saurian nochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for one year I would say" "" "" "" "yes!" "" "" "" "before which I was afraid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected style. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "" "" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "" "" "Estimates" for unexplainable reasons. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "" "" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you invite me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" word for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm an author. I think things out, bring you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are produced simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days with four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs that I have created myself, and not only produced, so even in the evening. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, country or classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fantasies, and it is true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, one tolerates a high sound, delivering a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, stressful and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began with television production when I began to work and work, build, create, and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzzing is music. the buzzing is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The hum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such sums, you cannot strive for size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more involved barriers, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzzing. I am the hum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzzing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single work stitcher.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says," "" "" "" "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, working weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "make you stupid, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you do, you do, you love what you do, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late on and she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">"" "" "" "and I want to say No when two things are aware of me:" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "" "" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, it did not call me" "" "" "" "estimate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm Titan and my buzzing is betrothed, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door approaches and an energy shift enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as though I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the working buzzing, the titanium umbs, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am if I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functionally my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzzing is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real hum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispers to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a fixed rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not pretty much like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what kind of person does better work than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always travel to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring it up for 15 minutes, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on track!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But there are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's all about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education, when I wanted to outdo myself more and more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz returned in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy floods in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the hum, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my hum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summing of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowing to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who is going to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said yes to less work and more games." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the summing. the land I create, the marathon, I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzz: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of being alive within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel that sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm an author. I think things out, I'll catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">A dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "" "" "I said" "" "" "" "Yes" "" "" "" "to less work and more games." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nervous functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure, they have heard from one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." in this process, one implantiates an electrode in the brain to influence the switching circles of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save lives, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, one sometimes needs to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, immature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may know from the biology lesson that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left behind us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential source of cells that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to keep them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reignited them at the removal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- autootransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we strike these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we caused an injury and matured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been matured.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we in vitro, dyed in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we last in the motoric cortex the hand motor sector.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some extent, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the ape, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have discovered a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant it with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest hindrances are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and have tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventor of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchanging madness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great copycats in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my ugly friends who repeatedly told me that the democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup lie in error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truly and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are mitigated, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to draw attention to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks" paradox.</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could take off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity needs, for example, green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, England and the euro area, trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">The 3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflame the stock prices and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in a continuous loop, boosts the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus Father, who from fear, the prophecy of the Oracle could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the fact that the body kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my contradiction with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the non-productive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, Athenian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and that it was not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same weighting in questions of the public concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">Our liberal democracies, however, do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our modern democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, by gradually substituting the policy and dismaying it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power has been cut off from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my havings with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated that at the end they are starving.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it harms itself through the self-provoked economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor attain a position only by a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low wages through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste is more sublime, and the social conflicts more deeply, just as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperauto, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conquests he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to research the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora" in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it need to look like this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of "Matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you, in brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no extraneous twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vacillating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment instruments are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time the liberal, in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and so I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not mad, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have clearly stated what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocative, China is today similar to the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now see in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To accuse China now to do what the West has done itself in the nineteenth century smells terribly to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to the complacency and the continuous denial that a massive valorisation line went through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to choose denial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it may perhaps be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he said he did not make any mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the creditors' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They simply wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "" "" "none of the troika of the creditors who imposed this policy on us admitted:" "" "" "" "this was a colossal error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we permit ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of the Europeans and the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most have never heard of it even though he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is managing employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an igel hairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are at the very right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site, which is based on 1 to 10 and shows how many shows receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after a season has looked, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to suppress "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium output, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon lays things out for nothing, is it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and the answer is:" "" "" "" "Amazon should make Sitcom via four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "" "" "yes," "" "" "" "Alpha House" "" "" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- literally -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organising a competition, he and his team have watched the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1-rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gather millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working this way, this is a little frightening, because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the Multi-Health Systems company here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in jail are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that by data analysis, they could predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- by analyzing Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced by experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise men can use many data unimaginably to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components so that you can analyse the parts; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the pieces and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intellect wherever they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "this is telling us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fencing it later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I've made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Perhaps the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
