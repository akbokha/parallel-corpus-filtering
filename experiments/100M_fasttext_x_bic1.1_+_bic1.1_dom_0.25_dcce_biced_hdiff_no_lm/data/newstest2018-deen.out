Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a chapel , which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small gar@@ den@@ ers farm the erst@@ while basis of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car navigation device was showing a green me@@ adow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but current - but that is why it is very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online tickets .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one cannot recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called prototype sheets , were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying programme between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from the first sur@@ veying in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville were finally with@@ drawn from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph further@@ ed the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying .
the information sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was incorporated as a Munich district for 21 years after the map was created .
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the u@@ prising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : the zo@@ oming in appears a smaller @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the properties were deduc@@ ed .
small plots have no more farmers in this area - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the district of the present district of the district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ usions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ asylum @-@ asylum &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; was created .
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the bet@@ ting of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k asylum in hair in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Am@@ per Hospital Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric atri@@ ates .
young people in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich meet in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities .
west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural all@@ usion to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ te , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bom@@ bing .
around 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; Main Square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where the ground@@ work and the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station will take place on 5 April 2017 .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizens &apos; Rights Group publishes War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ oes issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take particular care when travelling through the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur l@@ ately throughout the state and are noted here , &quot; stated in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release the war@@ fare , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are sm@@ ashed or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group c@@ ited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and was taken seriously by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Chief Prosec@@ utor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that in the state black mot@@ orists are employed 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring che@@ wing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an crime report of the F@@ BI , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states have adopted immigration laws that engage local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration fraud , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ des@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met in the right @-@ hand courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of wood@@ land , supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market@@ able path for the milk of its cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only region@@ ally arrives .
since he is also the BL@@ O chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot;
I cannot operate profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area ensures a lot of work , much has to be done with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the promotion of leaders . &quot;
farmers should be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often cri@@ tici@@ zed because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence .
this means that the maintenance area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested by at least 2023 .
between the total costs of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphasized : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Peter Weiß , too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Research ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg grants the state subsidies for f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the premis@@ e is the presence of a grant set marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be f@@ enced must not be tra@@ iled ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
a total of eight participants with 24 plots , who would like to build a 16 @-@ kilomet@@ re fence , is currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s F@@ encing Project 2018 .
the maintenance area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans cher@@ ish them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Sad@@ dam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty is@@ mit@@ ators would have gotten him out if he had done it .
but it took its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world .
the poem on which you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it &apos;s about the contemporary resonance to the ro@@ aring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tr@@ ash , your poor , your oppressed masses who asp@@ ire to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ umps are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their words after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical visual representation .
Lazarus altered this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus altered the significance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the road to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was quite unusual that Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their torch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the path , but ign@@ ite hatred , which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK &apos;s team
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the UK , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes has been chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special has developed in Scotland &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are Med@@ al candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ od@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 m hur@@ dles in her fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ sman is in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes during the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has installed five British and two European recor@@ ders last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season with the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics via Facebook : don &apos;t get a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to strike him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed in criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s staff have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained of it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his vot@@ ers and playing his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but that exactly happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servant to cri@@ tici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last modified the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable p@@ ore had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ dents hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort as the ren@@ aissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organiz@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh , said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid Gulf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; said Director Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are more or less in time , &quot; says the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which repeat@@ ed@@ ely hin@@ ders the construction work , is a big problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the public buses were allowed to go through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty st@@ ress@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold Land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use a stove .
it uses only rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ iment in the un@@ troubled Indones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the cl@@ ad no@@ d@@ ules are picked up and dev@@ oured with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be too late to work dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which led to independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who enter@@ tains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers from it .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car ride with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo shiel@@ ds , and corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ian people have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tort@@ ured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal high land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide .
the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone in the region .
&quot; we value everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , because Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indones@@ ian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ kow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jo@@ kow@@ y in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jo@@ kow@@ sky &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers stro@@ ked their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , hun@@ ted and killed the group with their ri@@ fle bul@@ lets , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle constantly and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters started hur@@ ling stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says TIME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an , who like many Indones@@ ian only bears a name , the TIME in a glo@@ omy atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , he held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety minister Wir@@ anto spoke in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately started .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses have already been buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ g@@ ations with gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , fear being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested from the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and witnessed how the injured are quickly delivered here , said TIME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers to take account of the police and withdraw the Police Brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ dder for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at the airport of Nab@@ ire since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to bring their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ sky &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on Indones@@ ian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically seen the OP@@ M supported .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , n@@ atives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part at the meeting , but still wanted to remain anonymous .
Indonesia announced another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jo@@ kow@@ y again .
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ sky is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants Jo@@ kow@@ y to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jo@@ kow@@ sky as a &quot; blame &quot; he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area just across the street from the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give them justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one coinci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at scre@@ aming of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who called his name George Sor@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units dropped the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said it was working on providing accommodation for the people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages occurred from the fair@@ ing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with its great Davis Cup cou@@ ps at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
although these often very long , but even therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ pack classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving your application .
not until the vote , after many sp@@ ells , the proposal came before the proposal to take the final on a neutral place .
only compar@@ atively smaller details will be available from 2018 : the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup fin@@ alists will have the host right in the first round of the year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US Travel@@ ers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a passenger survey found that more than 20 percent of subjects deliberately or un@@ consciously sm@@ ug@@ gled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally carried away forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were late discovered that they were mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Char@@ ter@@ service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent was Mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally caused by T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have kno@@ w@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately sent banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it had inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidental sm@@ ug@@ gling goods were brought by airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they can take along or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of objects caught by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
Elektro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far been suggest@@ ing that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more col@@ oss@@ al sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time revealed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in the event of a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1,000 pounds ) &quot; reservation deposit &quot; completely back .
at the moment 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations have been made , and Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders could be addressed .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be - all models taken together in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 one million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are added per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions at maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to major delays , then the in@@ consistency of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from explo@@ iting in dro@@ ves .
EPA head P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws from the Obama @-@ era rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , resig@@ ned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , when his agency turned out to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities to react faster than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint lo@@ dged against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline exp@@ iring on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ ten has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ten regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals ruled in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ten proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ lment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then waited to be prosec@@ uted by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA opinion that P@@ ru@@ ten at some point will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the sen@@ ate was not yet put to vote in the Senate .
the New York Public Prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed EPA during this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congregations , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said .
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ linois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ egen un@@ surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , a ser@@ en@@ ade was invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ ef@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful location .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc a concern .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer auto@@ graph : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen including the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document according to the document , on the Tum@@ ble Mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ al Law belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement @-@ centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age came from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , buried and occupied with a past@@ or , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this own church .
the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop was connected with it .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two is sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be left in 1942 during the Second World War .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were enc@@ amped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ lingen Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Swiss radio stations .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary church was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
during the New Year &apos;s Night of 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only today still existing tower wer@@ g remained a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; Schaff@@ ners pensions &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as organis@@ ers , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , 16 July , invite the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is made by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to end the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers turn out the fantastic view .
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and horns .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc are particularly committed to their homeland care , as ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim ref@@ uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim ref@@ uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked District Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; of the landscape .
although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette only a few days earlier - but the district government of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf had not authorized it because of a formal error .
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be removed , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permission of the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant letters have been addressed last week at the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter once more .
however , they presum@@ ably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the roughly 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ wheel@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re aims to invest around € 20 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing together : woman dies with terrible accident

a woman was wounded to death .
two more people were injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .

city and dealer schedule &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ dar@@ e@@ ers and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
like the chairman of the business association , Christian König , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for what offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commodity .
a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned .
local firms should also present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight &quot; shopping .
in doing so , the promotion aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
there@@ with , the business association and the city are going to another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest along with sales @-@ ready Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals had lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations .
it was a matter of over@@ coming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wi@@ dened , king said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that in Germany &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns will take part for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings by his buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new more people were injured .
at a gas explosion in the U.S. City Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard .
according to the fire brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still another wounded in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first mis@@ chief was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a matter of fact , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
tr@@ ump set under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall by telephone calls through in@@ gest@@ ed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
the US president compl@@ ained that he had den@@ ounced the Wall publicly . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees , who immig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists run ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a middle aged man in a needle trap suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the passengers were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a reflection .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everybody in the audience cast out very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 , citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been bl@@ amed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organization of post @-@ creation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law@@ maker .
for him , the post @-@ order serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injus@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot attain healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff placed a blanket over the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but no one ever was accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court ruling enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their first vote in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com writes a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - suppos@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks told me that the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , such as the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the assass@@ ination , removing evidence and has concealed the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a pol@@ l @-@ right massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual appointment of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , gri@@ pping , and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ter for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not like that , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ ister Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es and presses him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always gig@@ gling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy trying to get it right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when As@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a sad@@ ness of sad@@ ness , stands on the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays @-@ mour@@ ning praise to &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators whis@@ ks sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the road .
they all experienced Georgi@@ an humidity almost eight hours , when Bro@@ oks guides them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels g@@ ho@@ stly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name .
children sit on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w ar@@ ouses Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona ar@@ ouses two of his fellow players and then collap@@ ses in their arms we@@ eping , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta touches the post with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was struggling to find words about what feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does to me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ching continues to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s court sits at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is in some way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ coloured st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ floor setting .
the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) features a fo@@ aming street corner along with the B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is attracted by his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already mar@@ vel@@ ously in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess se@@ duc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , lock a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk and give the Kra@@ gel@@ o cli@@ que in Hollywood @-@ style .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously nasty Hagen surrounding the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brut@@ ally the scene when he sm@@ ashes Siegfried .
later on , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are humble and de@@ fle@@ cted the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ ell@@ binding post @-@ concert . five years later , there was great jubil@@ ation in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were under@@ going .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of the point of view grew .
I prefer a positive summary .
max Quantity Works As Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in their volunteer year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture w@@ allet , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open all day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
amount : it &apos;s a nice , wide range that I see here .
I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself , what are you doing .
do a social year , as there is an insight , you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
crowd : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in a different way than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ken .
one repeat@@ ed@@ ely has other people in the head , who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son cr@@ ashes more 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and sh@@ orten its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing .
the job cuts that General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May in a third cost cutting program Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business driven by the quick pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 5 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , killed a N@@ ato soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram area .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , including 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 displac@@ ed the T@@ ali@@ ban from power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump sums up the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es choice to delay the smo@@ g rule by defe@@ ats
the U.S. environmental protection authority has decided to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , under which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states lam@@ ented the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ stipul@@ ations 2015 , &quot; and said it was showing the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and from respon@@ ding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to assess the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to bring back a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the demo@@ crats and nature groups who worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA website says that breathing air containing o@@ zone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
community council wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the district council of flu@@ o @-@ win@@ kling decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while the church is still owned by the church , it will still take a while , but there is no planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are in front of not seeing such a common room as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ish residence , but openly enter into the community .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which has already been decided in the past autumn by providing funds for the current budget , is influenced by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room , T@@ j@@ aden , reports with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect it is impossible to disc@@ ard any b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the statement that both semi @-@ tra@@ ilers - which are le@@ aning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pitch roof - which reduce the tr@@ ump height and make the construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says , this addition .
when it helps : it will pass unanim@@ ously to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many buildings that are not going to be so well ahead , but now they lean out of the window at the common room , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to deal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but receive a genuine , in doubt , market@@ able counter@@ value , the counter @-@ speech is .
according to State &apos;s request to ple@@ dge the proposal , three pro@@ pon@@ ents will be found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two counter@@ parts to the original program , which sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision in this way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
col@@ lision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and was seriously injured .
like the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bicycle path of Schwar@@ zer Weg in the direction of Hil@@ den on the bicycle path .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver driving in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove onto the road , however , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retin@@ opath@@ y .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF und Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel of the German football record master Bayern München become ever larger at Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in a du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
the Mu@@ j@@ en Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are also missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult and intensive game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
hike from star to star in the Harz Mountains
the first &quot; star trail &quot; is to be built in the Harz Mountains .
this is planned by the association observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many people visiting the resin , called it .
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to put pla@@ ques along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ quiry come St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards will be added by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
later , the Star Path should be extended by train .
&quot; in the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association stated .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is far away .
it is also possible to medi@@ ate in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association runs the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet route since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ele with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the whole distance of the planet is a good four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fix would take half a year .

Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia who were to stand in a col@@ lision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future among 147 pounds met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ f@@ aded World Boxing Council lightweight champion going down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four Di@@ visi@@ one World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia sque@@ e@@ zed out his right hand saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled .
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weight @-@ pay@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate S asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was holding the generous praise for Gar@@ cia saying that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injuries to tire bur@@ ners
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was able to lose control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point market wide shortly before the connection point of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was closed in the direction of the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , if not the two opponents were against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain is to be further optimized .
and one goal after a free@@ will also doesn &apos;t want to catch any further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be the case for the future that no one else stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in the preparation with the supply chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we cannot afford such a lot of playing mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is driving to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a fail@@ ing start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know about this .
&quot; I first assessed the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann have believed that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh since they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s inner def@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland move into the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we will swe@@ ep it away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not be able to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish application for asylum seek@@ ers
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have under@@ gone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
in the course of the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some of the refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in more 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det was investigating the 5@@ 81 published results , she realized that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical grade evaluation , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of inf@@ ecting a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Construction at the Police Department and Transport in the Pres@@ idency of the Government of Freiburg .
in April the works began simultaneously on all three renovation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the timet@@ able is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has arrived in the years now .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurb@@ ished .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge stage on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as an operating road .
on the southern part of the bridge a width of 2.@@ 20 metres should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way should run .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridges .
a special sense of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
for bridges between the building yard building and the collective past@@ ure in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat is coming together .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle , Ron@@ dell , to the &quot; great campaign opening act . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top @-@ duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ dealers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel stays colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain area , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ian potato salad , which also the Af@@ D can eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police ordered a lot of police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing a presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D volcano ice , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for a cancellation at first , but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at about 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse or@@ ators , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 clock clearing up .
the police can move off - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets Tr@@ ump@@ et
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore , &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have set solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo trumpet of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; un@@ ites with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing combine to a fascinating overall art work .
this spring of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ o ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with each one I have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it never conf@@ uses or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , she suffered according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but during school time when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the kids told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to live in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic nomin@@ ee H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited from his father a coal business .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Govern@@ ors Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership , and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of Athletics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday of what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed into sport again .
Russian Athletics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ el said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the rep@@ orter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its rein@@ tro@@ duction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added .
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must fulfill some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fun@@ eral ceremony for soldiers who died in Mali
during a fun@@ eral service in the northern H@@ essi@@ an town of F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the yet un@@ explained cause of the crash .
but she called the two opposite pilots as &quot; sponsors of their field . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have accomplished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from North Hessen have died on Wednesday a week in Mali in West Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and of politics began .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
sad@@ ness , ro@@ ses lay down , the relatives were standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the comm@@ anding soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and a sat@@ anic tear .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the air@@ plane of the Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ah@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen , did not show : the mission was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared with the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally taught in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik would be buried is still un@@ clear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also replaces the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king @-@ house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a severe stance in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign on the Dan@@ es .
Hen@@ rik expressed in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk st@@ umps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
two mistakes were the same ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is resig@@ ned after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the Parliament voted on the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise withdrawal of a Green Party from its State Parliament fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen co @-@ founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants his Group to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this meant that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regularly on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the day of land as quickly as possible resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the country tag with@@ draws the trust of the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be insp@@ ected legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler named T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apo@@ state MPs to return to their state meeting .
&quot; of course , we assume that she returns to her country @-@ day mandate which she has received through the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to have any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Alliance of Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal Minister of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday wrote on Facebook .
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politi@@ cian , &quot; in their last vanity and fru@@ stration , expressed their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty in@@ filtration process and attempts to capit@@ alize on it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the SPD &apos;s head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen plans to dist@@ ort the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 with a personal career .
the CD@@ U , at that time , was the strongest force in the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Land@@ tag .
agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers safeguard themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Herr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and to check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the concerned parent bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all that we know at this time , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
Al@@ di now assumes the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ may of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has the same concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time are not the establishments to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production plants do not have immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little check@@ ers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only at the staff or at the concl@@ usive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled out by 100 percent .
it is precisely because of this that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which crimes can be submitted are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular Alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an insec@@ ti@@ cide is not used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ ghtly stamped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the sli@@ pped agent , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be immediately termin@@ ated .
this has to be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps .
how the financial rules of soccer can impact Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer to Ne@@ y@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PSG can certainly make the money easy for Ne@@ y@@ mar to sign and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their activities on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken huge debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favor of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his new UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ ale continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum of costs for the next five years amounts to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PSG won a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the normally normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ w@@ it their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar could be made via payments from the 2022 World Cup Organ@@ izing Committee .
but PSG and Q@@ at@@ ari 2022 argu@@ ed that Ne@@ y@@ mar World Cup Amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be and such a maneu@@ ver could be easily identified for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to keep in mind every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A didn &apos;t have a preliminary talk with PSG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest published reports show that PSG with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PSG is expecting Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a bo@@ on for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PSG .
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways or may have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ orn@@ eur
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the close cooperation is at a possible end : the airline writes the order an@@ ew .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white bag@@ ged duc@@ tile panels spread over 14 grams per year before landing at the passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of the order according to &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty by spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss music boards have been distribut@@ ing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss concluded a contract with the daughter of Mig@@ ros , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of First Class are spoiled with delic@@ acies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit is Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups , who now play an adult , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the fo@@ undry principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sha@@ kes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ walter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; mou@@ st@@ ache , his former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old h@@ acker .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I suppose as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; compound Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East against West ring fight icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director speci@@ fies to be a found TV series : a roman@@ ian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , how Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ agent mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long epis@@ odes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compound Det@@ ective , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was edited on a lower length could better supply its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist public is that western culture can make everything a fo@@ dder for a promise .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to beat the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also secured larger quantities of mar@@ ihu@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of the Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large scale was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly returned to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
wise su@@ ing large gaps in the register of foreigners
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the German Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the export Central Register .
in the case of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could &quot; lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to statistics , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good until now .
in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not be able to appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on people who have already been able to travel , EU citizens are also included who would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but such false attri@@ butions led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy once they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in paper , it means that BA@@ MF perform such proceedings regarding families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the paper is referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave up for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) regards these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ le@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who received awards on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has 100 donations in the meantime distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation acknowledged the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is designed and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps a number of people , &quot; explained the Regional Sales Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ en@@ bacher , as the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
thus three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ en@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 spin @-@ offs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district preparation manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the@@ atri@@ um has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ding@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times per 500 milli@@ liters of their life @-@ juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members striving to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and forecast for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that interest income would be necessary over the next few years to raise the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak short @-@ term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , emphasized that increases were &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this and next year are in comparison with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to make no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened growing expectations on interest rates and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households which are affected by rising inflation and in@@ significant increases in salary , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes worse first before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the fund .
the Bank estimates it will probably take four years until it will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdi@@ ct on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will reti@@ re in the coming months .
the Bank said that the ratio to its goal of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; due to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in the N@@ HS after a fight in front of the High Court in September .
N@@ HS UK announced that pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , are now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for approximately 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; an important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in whole England in April 2018 .
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection haz@@ ards .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als , and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply medications this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is targeted , implemented and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ hau@@ l the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted and endangered people are targeted , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and delay by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country in order to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to a step closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Bank@@ er with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne does not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the square foot of 1,000 square feet has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage box and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate ground in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without losing ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper viewing window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering was involved , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push up the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot;
thanks to clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and thus help create an emotional bond inside a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself into something completely aston@@ ish@@ ingly by a good design and increased square footage of some standard .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might decide to not leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate imperi@@ alis@@ ms worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - von Paul described as &quot; main operator and domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file says that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 316 million and has a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening statements proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first case in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first court hearing took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some sessions in a competent way .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies such as Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 19@@ 50s and purchased a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a bi@@ ographer from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ umps plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with executive officers on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House that he wanted to fix : bad news coming into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ umps Rel@@ ation@@ ship to television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed for un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said former election campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping the Twitter habit controlled , according to six former election campaign officers , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s t@@ witter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign statements know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s twe@@ ets without their interventions had even more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never hear anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times , their efforts were worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example of rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they originate from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone had malicious intent on sending a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the web site of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has vo@@ iced up false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House General Secretary , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .
the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought after heavy criminals are not known naturally , information from the population is hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting in the holiday destinations were hiding , called it by Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 postcards for searched offen@@ ders from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ eps has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online applications could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who have negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the municipality to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the Trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters once they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their occurrence .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and sque@@ e@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers only to be lo@@ oted from another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a speaker of the Soli@@ h@@ ull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the stra@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many local residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birk@@ enhof will become the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt will be renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of Birk@@ enhof at the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and already spoke of serious interested in the house .
he was right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
in Birk@@ enhof &apos;s former Hotel Birk@@ enhof is standing in front of the entrance since a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should become &quot; really bourgeois @-@ close &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when it comes to investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to commit himself exactly .
just below a million Euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outer complex@@ es are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator uses the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the committee , in recent weeks , took up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter .
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there are already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been bl@@ aming the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to be pur@@ pos@@ efully incorporated into the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men should stand , who acted as consultants of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more tr@@ umps , private and business environment .
the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; a few weeks ago , wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accus@@ ation that the President might have ob@@ struc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to raise charges .
Grand Jury are therefore also called Ank@@ le Cham@@ bers .
in most cases , they are switched on when it deals with larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge people to inter@@ ro@@ gate E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former Chief Executive Officer Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller does not allow himself to be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign against its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the demo@@ crats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury .
but this usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House re@@ bu@@ ts any measures that accelerated the work of the Sonder@@ kom@@ mor in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
alle@@ g@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been no@@ isy due to the fact that he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
comm@@ ey , in June , said before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him for an investigation of the investigations against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to dism@@ iss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators proposed draft bill on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could not be dismis@@ sed as easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg was solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely seven times the size of Berlin .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the giant col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a billion metric tons and weighs 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving nor@@ th@@ ward and will probably need two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the sl@@ ump of the ic@@ e@@ berg is un@@ clear according to research data .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
the ice shelf s@@ war@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glac@@ iers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was dis@@ rupted several years ago .
a complete Shel@@ f is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart , if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of the ice shelf and the ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice is displac@@ ed as much water as it does after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glac@@ iers flowing directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small measure , writes the British research project on the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is the fourth biggest sho@@ vel of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic after A@@ WI .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres .
it regularly breaks down there .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the start of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists were argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C flag@@ ship will grow back or fold back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
although these scientists do not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the polar s@@ nu@@ kes of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends in the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus nar@@ rows into the areas where the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants home tari@@ ff at the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls for the employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in administration were achieved .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 tra@@ inees their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
there were some 620 applications for the places to be missed this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack resources to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ an@@ cies at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the lack of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development according to the parties &quot; wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself in@@ ward and extern@@ ally , show specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an apprentices@@ hip offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he was already in the cra@@ y@@ ons for a rotten surprise when he ques@@ tioned the pay@@ roll cover publicly and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
peoples want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come short @-@ term to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a household tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually pre@@ views the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; youth Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had effectively co@@ operated with tra@@ ffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth Rett@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes infl@@ atable boat migrants , which are delivered to them directly by tra@@ ffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the file of the prosec@@ utor whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to hold the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or ob@@ struc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , Nobel prize @-@ winner organization Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin Bran@@ ch &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy three days of tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
for this purpose three friendly guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal has proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ kap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream pl@@ ains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , there was a view point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wn &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a number of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
the bi@@ kers arrived in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
Neu@@ stadt was also headed .
after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - German le@@ ague matches for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium racing during wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
these are also recognised by the first Bundes@@ lig@@ a@@ ver@@ eine , which is increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Director Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets more often than just once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ aments to Asia .
what is it about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level .
as in normal sport , li@@ lies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ett too has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction to reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and take care of nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but ac@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integ@@ rative impact of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
that is little against the € 2.4 billion of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers write .
many countries have already travelled internationally .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says ac@@ rob@@ atic .
according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now committed to setting up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany lag@@ s behind in European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board member Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall in nostal@@ gia and to en@@ ligh@@ ten the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; D@@ utt , too .
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything stays the same with football as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter found guilty of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy driving for suicide
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and spent five years on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for a neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions urged Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor told the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I am not mour@@ ning the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; he says .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person I have been with since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts that makes it a crime to call another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is switch on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should take advantage of the case through some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ ber was allowed to run as a captain on the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern is a big season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that did Joshua Kim@@ ber right away , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide apart from the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he simply joined the arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first deployment as a Bayern captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the stand could have run better than with the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also point to Kim@@ ber@@ ley .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen as a player in the C @-@ el@@ f , who had come from youth , de@@ but@@ ant and especially on vacation , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who are given a lot of trust , which one wants to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed across the field as a Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m .
to the right rear , that is its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ ber@@ ley also worked in this start@@ ling like the one who can take the helm best into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ skilled tro@@ upe .
he had the sight for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al thus re@@ play his missing fitness ( barely folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on Devil come out to the accompl@@ ishments of the Asia travel ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , that worked out quite well .
in addition to Kim@@ mir , Rud@@ y ran away from the def@@ ences , and both of them were confident .
the well @-@ deser@@ ved Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game set up .
his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed good performance at the debut .
game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
how unusual this Bayern World is still for the new arri@@ vals , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Rud@@ y did not give one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new te@@ amm@@ ers after a few clicks .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting pro@@ position : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed .
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba motivated O@@ FB Women

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ ced pace
it was often in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies in the region speak on a change in economic policy on T V demand - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ er sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the closure of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 the construction law shall stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ b@@ ypass Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport .
the goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ speaking teacher Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) in Trier is striving for the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that had been bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , and they praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts in Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is en@@ vis@@ aged for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are independent within ten years of master training .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction will quickly create facts , at the same time lacking the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
to date , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bald@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president , Christian Bald@@ auf , points out more than 20 million euros less than suggested in the maintenance of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
there is also a so@@ ber@@ ing broad@@ band extension in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the grid supplies in an I@@ HK survey only with Note 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months for in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving limitations , &quot; thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - forbi@@ d@@ ding or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of conce@@ aling the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but to drive back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a demand focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could make Volkswagen difficult : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft ride through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
when it comes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there is a big raft between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction reference wants to clear up .
one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent on the raft .
it shows a g@@ arbage dump .
the start to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar should shar@@ pen as a worthy game of game .
last summer , the raft sail@@ ed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Ch@@ est nos@@ es and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published carto@@ on characters , the keys of his characters are his trademarks .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still playing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
during the first years as an artist , he worked among others as dra@@ fts@@ man for greeting cards - which fru@@ strated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours .
through cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , its dro@@ ll@@ ing figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ ers as a counter@@ part .
his figures are for the first time in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come back to the screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without any word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and the diseases transmitted due to illness , which prepares scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , cause major head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agriculture research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ ises said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .

a journalist assass@@ ination highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings will suff@@ ice .
there are drug tra@@ ffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s walking list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals threatening the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are he@@ aped up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has resig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are pending attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .
among the latter are her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ c building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters will discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to handle the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers are rarely tried by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ sius , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are im@@ partial and although the terrain is even more tra@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce newspaper in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to travel a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranqu@@ ill@@ ity if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez had become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country at his own security , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for the Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the smoking problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .
rep@@ orters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ z , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever she was .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many sco@@ oters ? why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always keep his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now they ask , was his love for routine destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ c in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters ques@@ tioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trust@@ worthy of the governor .
it has been months since the rep@@ orters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former renowned speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the provincial town of the governor .
and there was a group that carried out a kid@@ n@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez over@@ took a few notes and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by typ@@ ing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking routes and buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the Val@@ dez case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put themselves under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Media W@@ guard Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her detached head .
some branches have been selected , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed publicly to the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women , was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug tra@@ ffi@@ cker fri@@ ghtened him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz@@ ing .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan swimming pool had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ b@@ oul@@ der , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez saw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ o followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , alb@@ eit an alarm@@ ing one .
researchers have now discovered that the first evidence of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain rider has been so well maintained that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that its sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best known pan@@ de@@ mic din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state amaz@@ es researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he arrived at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something missing out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , was probably threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily fortified din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ ters made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of this specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading , a common def@@ ensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than lo@@ ot , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal at po@@ inters about his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what he has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sk@@ inn@@ ed skin , but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fri@@ ght@@ ful predec@@ essors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank into the sea after death and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he arrived at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved fortified din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that were sha@@ ken by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the fortified plant e@@ aters flo@@ wed through western Canada until an floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are preserved so well that the cre@@ sts cover still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a winning lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tanks that carry the skull of the animal .
its right front foot is on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long st@@ out - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , there were about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , in each other , between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm .
at first there was no information about the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long retreat was formed .
as an AZ rep@@ orter reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the license plates of the vehicle bank@@ ers , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive sentences .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. there was another crash on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a col@@ lision between a car transp@@ orter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .

a test operation is currently underway on two routes .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the ticket without Schaff@@ ner .
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be purchased through the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for electronic depreci@@ ation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train driver arrives at the ticket control at PLA@@ Y , he knows that a passenger is seated there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn should be used by passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without a ticket control by our train atten@@ d@@ ants , simply check in the DB Navigator .
this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB distant marketing manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often you don &apos;t have all the documents you need for the validation of online tickets in any case , but one of the fellow travelers .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to prove is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same track are not yet enabled .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose stra@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly kept on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed , black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she switched off her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets later in the evening about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman sent his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l reminded her of her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had so many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded her of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what has happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only to know the tivis@@ m and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a poor service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of ac@@ tivis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was president of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
Fer@@ rel@@ l came up with a question : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already co@@ operated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m around death penalty occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ r@@ illon &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ r@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and her wife mar@@ ries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the glori@@ fication of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ r@@ tells &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ lists Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to remember that since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the issue hardly leaves one cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the Bit @-@ Gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build a gallery attra@@ cting more customers into the city , including the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property in which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years now .
chi@@ ef@@ ly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very will@@ ingly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery res@@ ett@@ les , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are hired only by larger companies in a shopping centre , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a pity that specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall go during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes actually .
or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to distribute all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the crazy many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg give you no more room for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching res@@ emb@@ lance : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble cables hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly classified diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( a matching res@@ emb@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg obtained the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , alb@@ eit slightly intellectual comment not only for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six off@@ ences against the spy@@ ware , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette dum@@ bs and che@@ wing gum , extra@@ cting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not attend this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became too un@@ equal to bri@@ efs , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of the seas would turn into judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ of of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as astonishing , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people hope to take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , spy memories , are also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States of disciplinary fields like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put up your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was also aimed at how everything was in the exhibition up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man &apos;s stat@@ ure ) in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of North@@ western and an Oxford University of Applied Sciences
a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who will be looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the C@@ ook County court court .
the documents indicate that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them should now be in absence and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanted him to surrender .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of themes , including a potential domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the road@@ map criteria , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ entry of Rus@@ ada and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged feder@@ ally funded dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has found an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was excluded from performing dop@@ ing checks in Russia during the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the WA@@ DA .
it was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that Rus@@ ada moved into the right direction in order to be re @-@ deployed .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys don &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not dare the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is at the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demo@@ graphic groups , to offer employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance with which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .

Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converts has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , converts enterprises can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds a company that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden by executives , who were sitting in offices in cities or countries , can be identified and addressed faster like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that businesses knew that they could not prevent their dirty washing online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both startups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million from financing companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just stak@@ es .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In who both share both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can grow fru@@ stration and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always ob@@ tains new insights into employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before they return to the Aqu@@ man Football Center at 6 : 30 am the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal match preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if it adds another point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been cast with foot@@ balls having a protective grid locked behind a pe@@ at , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then recru@@ it there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then display their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to factor authentication , which may display results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks are to be punished if they fail to remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate explanation in German that a test of the new facts check was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual audi@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his hom@@ ey seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a predi@@ le@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Man &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have responded only to the print of the thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his print of thumb !
and letters are always sm@@ elling smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gift &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ bri@@ ds on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that show what possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader base , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant u@@ prising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant u@@ prising began in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l depic@@ ts his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed quite ro@@ gues , getting debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to promote hei@@ r . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his team of marketing headed by Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and the slogan heated until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rhine since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the promotion , it &apos;s about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is imperative to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other local authorities .
with a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara is advis@@ ing the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on retirement and promotion in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week as well .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the Pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defense , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the consult@@ ations .
the number of civilians in Y@@ AS was thus over .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismis@@ sed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a master of the coup attempt .
against 48@@ 6 persons , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had referred the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; given him the opportunity to &quot; clean &quot; the forces entirely .
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the head@@ line &quot; Un@@ ease in Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on head@@ sc@@ ars for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale cleaning of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , by decree , Erdo@@ gan ordered a further 73@@ 95 public servants , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly considered the real masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the EU reform proposals .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries following the coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the operational readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the media .
it pre@@ fers to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for ticket shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the race ticket has been cont@@ ested again and again - now it should go very quickly .
before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist railway goes , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race ticket long @-@ term , construction works will begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and rehabil@@ it@@ ating the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; states Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the track amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
this is the sum of 75 percent of the country .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , will be fin@@ alized at the moment , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this makes the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negoti@@ ated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race @-@ gate shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 .
the race @-@ gate shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route has been used by enough people to re@@ order them regularly in the future .
in addition , the route is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more cra@@ zier , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the release of his new report .
modern s@@ exp@@ anders have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the personalities who would let a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , for example , sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ys Gold Sex @-@ robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an advent@@ u@@ rous personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , if one walks a step at Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ les one the most .
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point out to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
most men naturally will not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R sees their growing popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market is allowed to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ ises to have attacked women sexually .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic pictures , the nar@@ ro@@ wn@@ ess body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realis@@ tically as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their personalities , the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to put it in the words of 2017 : maid service
high performance pumps ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human understanding
it has become a KNO@@ W@@ LE@@ D@@ GE of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers in the US with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump limiting relatives .
we all o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly strive to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ hand poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dist@@ ressing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t b@@ ump us any more .
there is , however , an even more fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right Wing &quot; are norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards .
today I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both occurring in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy only to qualify as im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caff@@ eine .
the horses are enor@@ mously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are gro@@ wling and the animals twist in order to look fri@@ ghtened of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Top@@ ics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two 2 @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down in what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , while I was tired of the experience to hand her credit card with five stars .
Oscar piste with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrist , which he suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell .
because of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence , following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from guns and ear@@ posts were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening scho@@ ol@@ mate Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school release , the 29 pupils of the four classes chose a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then is released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower band called a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle at the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it bro@@ o@@ ded by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken cone , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a hen sm@@ ashed , and the eagle made his wings on a high mountain ; and he van@@ ished .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders wore to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young , however , is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ cup @-@ sler that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a word of gratitude to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again and again jumps in the class@@ room classes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cooking time is over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she only divor@@ ces her pupils after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler .
at the end all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade pupils have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally @-@ camp@@ ed people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control over the free camp and put on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the inspec@@ tions will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emission performance of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Car Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negoti@@ ated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have draft software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the Federal Chancell@@ ery ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but have not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework of the inspection .
how long will the conver@@ sions go on altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in says .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntary negoti@@ ators do not act on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es you to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would consider S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a threat of a massive fall in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
there is currently no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool Y Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy &apos;s Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool Y ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awards ceremony .
for this reason , the winner Le@@ ar , who has become familiar with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will refra@@ in from taking part in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker City Buil@@ der has been a master builder for 31 years .
and the work still gives him great fun , as he im@@ parts in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that until now no application fulfil@@ ls the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for el@@ ab@@ oration .
since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ contractor for the administrative association , the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the city and the city themselves are important to it , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the remo@@ del@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz has been initiated .
the bridge between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject to discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike a book of approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a master builder there is a lot of space available for the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what suits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city architect empha@@ sizes .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is responsible for high responsibilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of experience in care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
anyone who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with subject area of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law .
the Municipal Building Department under@@ goes civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management planning , gr@@ ass@@ land acquisition , municipal estate management , urban gar@@ dening and urban gar@@ dening as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on wires : South railway line closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle away from the railway crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them for the night .
near the crime scene witnessed a pink Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike rider from witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a rule of law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator or the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have put himself in great danger and endangered the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , even sponsors of the rail customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail transport on the South railway line could be managed without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were held Friday morning , two of them considered correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB driver Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in Britain causes cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been established that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needed tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han improves toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system is involved in people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , which was however separated , had not .
she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment , so that they had no intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria were affected by the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pres@@ e@@ ason game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes , which admitted Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent contained in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four primary commitments .
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. air@@ plane manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US State Mich@@ ig@@ an and retired in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing has already made such advertising .

new low @-@ impact driver for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD , the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister , always looked at Berlin with a certain concern .
but no fire from the party centre , merely a head@@ wind from the League , was the most important wish of the vot@@ ers .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be depend@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U general secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the Germany editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MPs threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal President Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Dutch Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the vot@@ ers &quot; will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Chief Prosec@@ utor of the Green Party to the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD vot@@ er si@@ ghs when the new Hi@@ ob message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , President of the SPD premi@@ er of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without their own government majority following the transition of the green members El@@ ke T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD &apos;s regional associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it then became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
lab@@ ori@@ ously , the comrades went up again in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just forged new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next deep beat .
mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his ni@@ mb@@ us this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication it turned out pretty much everything that could be wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has fought for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in critical position for a long time .
the questionn@@ aire was added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from ordination .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party &apos;s internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep their ranks closed .
their anger appe@@ als to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliament@@ ar@@ ers in T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic how Ms. T@@ westen combined her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ westen is not elected to parliament for her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to the Parliament via the state list of the Gre@@ ens of Lower Saxony , so the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on member continues .
the logical consequence would be to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er &apos;s will four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate to the German elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career @-@ giving of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties sli@@ ps the election results , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on to clarify the background .
I want to know if there was more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his old house can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday informed about this in sens@@ ations on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 there have been in sens@@ ations of rehabilitation areas .
back then , in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the restructuring area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; project of success &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that it will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest of the municipality sen@@ timent .
how does a rehabilitation camp develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned field at all to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renovation would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would object @-@ related , that is per plot , carried out .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding has expi@@ red since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would take place only once , in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation field a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December , the set @-@ up will be carried out as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every municipality must carry out the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned pre @-@ examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban ab@@ uses and deciding when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will , even once again , come to sens@@ ations and take a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and land arch , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation views .
in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; budget and housing sheet , &quot; data on size , layout and residents of a living space can be made .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building .
however , it is important to note that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , re@@ building measures should not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , warns first .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; have been shown to make a &quot; tasty &quot; refurb@@ ishment .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an aes@@ the@@ tist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House pays the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn , which highlights the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers up to $ 24@@ ,000 according to the military &apos;s information left to TIME magazine .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ truck from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military bure@@ au demanded the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his boss , the dep@@ uty marine man@@ ger for aviation .
the news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o &apos;clock in the evening .
the note adds that if the White House flight departure should be delayed , a second crew member is required due to the limitation of service hours .
the original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; answered the dep@@ uty commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump took an investigation when the presidential plane was running before the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty spokes@@ woman of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 practice land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training needs of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said an officer .
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for non @-@ presidential support missions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget records for presidential pl@@ ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft more than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the Federal State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky job

the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ ental Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite five games , still fla@@ w@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , especially the imports from the far north provide .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Fin@@ n can even point to bet@@ s at the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ova ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .

Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to ti@@ ghten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress kept a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the U.S. advance .

roll backwards : the town introduces 46 kitchen appliances
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
as of 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own reg@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is continued except house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers fresh tea ch@@ illed .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the kids get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year , 2,@@ 800 children were seated at the tables , and the need grows constantly .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days are at lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 2 : 00 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees will have a kitchen service since 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , leaving the food , clean up and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as si@@ zable units - decides the amount of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kitchen assist@@ ants now belong firmly to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the kite line to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with approximately 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said hundreds of women are candidate in the coun@@ cill@@ ors in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate un@@ reserv@@ edly and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ali@@ ban published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international action to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democra@@ tically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million registered vot@@ ers .

according to the police information , the men said to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 pm , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ go@@ w
a union wants to wi@@ eld the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ go@@ w on managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has vo@@ iced about the future of investing in the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ di said he invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s point was to &quot; div@@ est &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot get clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross is deeply concerned by our members .
generations of families have worked here and labour forces concentrate strongly on the local community and the Glas@@ go@@ w open area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the Eastern end of Glas@@ go@@ w urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager at Tol@@ l@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross plant , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site . if our operations at the location change , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona warn against Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may interest her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of Ne@@ y@@ mar after having submitted an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record incident ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a source near the Catal@@ an Executive Board that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?
when Manchester City became interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers for Ne@@ y@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW went on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ ach , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are a church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , he received from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Card@@ inal Joachim R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the pap@@ al Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then wrong assessment of the events .
the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; government , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; two measures &quot; were measured in the reporting on violence among the dom@@ es .
with regard to the interference in Regensburg , no one doubts that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ab@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ our@@ ful fres@@ her . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; strikes had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
they found it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely un@@ justified , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; Mein Bruder of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment ?
a total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral @-@ cats became victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ es sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
in the case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
in contrast to many other def@@ end@@ ants , however , many victims found that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in numerous cases , even bind positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence at prot@@ esters in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible when a cathedral treas@@ ury brought no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all .
he is just dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best pre@@ tend to experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed wing@@ ed co@@ whi@@ de and too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted for years , deeply regret and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , both with parents and teachers .
do you also know such cultivation methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is ad@@ mitt@@ edly Bag@@ at@@ elles .
you wonder if it &apos;s not to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report allevi@@ ates Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , a lot of information was reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger laid down in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the real issue in the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would certainly have been a colleague of the offen@@ ders to a certain extent .
how do Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that figured out ... Bu@@ ben have opened intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their environment , they could not be confirmed within the scope of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , George R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any con@@ ten@@ tion .
he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an advertisement .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is charged in the &quot; Weg@@ schau &quot; report .
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly divided : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let us say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ ining ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of As@@ di@@ stic teachers have been regularly ch@@ ed@@ ged and portra@@ yed , and suffered terri@@ bly , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , as most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different in the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ esh@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which the report actually re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the test penalty should continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative public@@ ity , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but it is not possible to say that he had always looked away .
that is just not true .
only in 1980 the official punishment for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of jud@@ ging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princ@@ ess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , ear @-@ co@@ es and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
what picture of his rain@@ s@@ burger times did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger bring in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot;
did the subject test sentence also become a language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , because the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I do not deny that there was a strict reg@@ iment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , the stub@@ born boy once again makes no great singers and stand before each success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom you could not imagine that he could only do something wrong with a fly .
I regularly get to know how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his dep@@ ortation , to visit him regularly , to visit him , to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him to this day , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plants are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .
and that he is always a good patri@@ arch@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they look still today and which they literally worship .
and please , once again quite clearly : all you have to do is educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without anyone outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
