<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "small gardeners farm the erstwhile basis of farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car navigation device was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but that is why it is very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called prototype sheets, were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying programme between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville were finally withdrawn from February 9, 1801, they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph furthered the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district for 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: the zooming in appears a smaller-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "primeval" from which the properties were deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no more farmers in this area - but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the district of the present district of the district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich district-asylum-asylum "Auf der Auer Lünen" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the betting of so-called" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chalk asylum in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatric atriates.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Salesianum in Munich meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural allusion to the original building of the Irrente, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing.</seg>
<seg id="44">Around 1856 the Marienplatz was registered as "Main Square," the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the groundwork and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station will take place on 5 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens' Rights Group publishes Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Faroes issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take particular care when travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, racial-based incidents occur lately throughout the state and are noted here," stated in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Bill of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the warfare, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, people pass." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are smashed or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and was taken seriously by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that in the state black motorists are employed 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "", "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring chewing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan crime report of the FBI, which classify the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states have adopted immigration laws that engage local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration fraud, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidesaun project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac made a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met in the right-hand courtyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woodland, supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the Feriengäste in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "" "" "is the alternative marketable path for the milk of its cows," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste only regionally arrives.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLO chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "elementary importance."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot operate profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much has to be done with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "" "", "said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the promotion of leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operations," "" "" "" "said the Mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">This means that the maintenance area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Between the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you do a really good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "for Peter Weiß, too," "" "" "" "here, best food is produced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Research (LPR) Baden-Württemberg grants the state subsidies for fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The premise is the presence of a grant set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced must not be trailed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">A total of eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build a 16-kilometre fence, is currently running for the Fisherman's Fencing Project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans cherish them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty ismitators would have gotten him out if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemporary resonance to the roaring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your trash, your poor, your oppressed masses who aspire to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their words after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classical visual representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus altered the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the road to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">It was quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the path, but ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK's team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the athletics of the UK, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes has been chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are Medal candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eiliodh naturally brought in were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles in her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsman is in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes during the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and has installed five British and two European recorders last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season with the British Team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics via Facebook: don't get a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to strike him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He ploughed in criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's staff have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained of it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "" "" "she wrote in the commentary box" The Post "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are rather disregarded as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the governor's staff referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servant to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last modified the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable pore had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="232">In the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year," said Director Heiko Becher.</seg>
<seg id="235">As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.</seg>

<seg id="248">If Bardina Degei cook dinner, she does not use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="249">It uses only rarely a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regiment in the untroubled Indonesian province Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour, the clad nodules are picked up and devoured with zealous, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei sits on the loam floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">Of course, it can be too late to work dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 5 pm," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, which led to independence from the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, who entertains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.</seg>
<seg id="260">In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="261">The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride with the rental car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="263">The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo shields, and corrugated iron roofs, which were transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable Goldmine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="278">According to the Asia-Human Rights Commission, mass killings in Papua's tribal high land in the 1970 "s became genocide.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="282">The screws have increased, because Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>

<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">One of the soldiers stroked their tone and later returned with four soldiers, so the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="296">The soldiers, who had drunk, hunted and killed the group with their rifle bullets, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children.</seg>
<seg id="298">One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was severely beaten to fall into coma.</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in a circle constantly and imitating a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood was heated, a command was sent over an internal radio: "if the masses do more than three times, they shoot them dead," says TIME, which was not released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home.</seg>
<seg id="305">No one was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, suddenly I was shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the verandah of his colorful painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="307">Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="309">The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.</seg>

<seg id="336">The shootings have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighborhood of Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24-year-old raviolanus douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited villagers protested from the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers cast stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting and killing one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives close to the hospital and witnessed how the injured are quickly delivered here, said TIME.</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers to take account of the police and withdraw the Police Brigade from the area.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a rudder for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, living in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of range.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived at the airport of Nabire since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosperous migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to bring their own companies competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowsky's campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia's unsettled provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including Paniai Shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically seen the OPM supported.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human right ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4th, natives broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that took part at the meeting, but still wanted to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia announced another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowy again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowsky is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shoots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants Jokowy to know that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowsky as a "blame" he has to pay back.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite threats and intimidations, the Paniai victims had a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried in an area just across the street from the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They know that they may never give them justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with his head.</seg>
<seg id="383">"what else can we do?"</seg>

<seg id="407">A passenger survey found that more than 20 percent of subjects deliberately or unconsciously smuggled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft, while they accidentally carried away forbidden knives or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they were late discovered that they were mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey conducted by more than 1,000 people, carried out by a Jet Charterservice, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent was Millennials compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally caused by TSA agents were foods and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly borne items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had deliberately sent banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it had interrogated travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidental smuggling goods were brought by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who fly most often.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure which liquids they can take along or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of objects caught by the TSA are forbidden liquids.</seg>
<seg id="418">For a while people thought TSA could watch books as smuggling goods.</seg>
<seg id="419">Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.</seg>
<seg id="420">Elon Musk does not care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders</seg>
<seg id="421">Elektro-thousandsassa Elon Musk enjoys the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far been suggesting that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more colossal sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk for the first time revealed another, less glamorous number: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63.000 have already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In the event of a cancellation Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1,000 pounds) "reservation deposit" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 455,000 such non-binding reservations have been made, and Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders could be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it should be - all models taken together in 2018 - 500,000 by 2020 one million." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are added per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions at maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA head Pruitt withdraws from the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he was accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, resigned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes, when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities to react faster than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline expiring on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt declared in June that he would delay observance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Trump's Attorney General of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington Pruten has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruten regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals ruled in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruten proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for the implementation and then waited to be prosecuted by activists and others, and in an agreement to establish the date for carrying out," said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the EPA opinion that Pruten at some point will use its "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The senate was not yet put to vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Public Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States who had sued EPA during this week, said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the reversal of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their congregations," Schneiderman said.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade was invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneffiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful location.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumarc a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer autograph: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen including the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the document, on the Tumble Mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the Church or the Patronal Law belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the magnificent settlement-centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage came from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, buried and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.</seg>
<seg id="478">The right to use a pastor or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop was connected with it.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two is shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be left in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlingen Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Swiss radio stations.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Night of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today still existing tower werg remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "Schaffners pensions" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and supporters of Tumarc on Sunday, 16 July, invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is made by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To end the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers turn out the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumors and horns.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumarc are particularly committed to their homeland care, as serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim refuses" "" "" "" "does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the councilor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "" "" "the association" "" "" "" "Boisheim refuses" "" "" "" "has asked District Council Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette only a few days earlier - but the district government of Dusseldorf had not authorized it because of a formal error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also to be removed," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permission of the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "this is where the issuance of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the relevant letters have been addressed last week at the district Viersen," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to examine the matter once more.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they presumably do not cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the roughly 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-wheelers.</seg>
<seg id="523">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the NEW Re aims to invest around €20 million." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg, Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langendareers and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to entice the inhabitants to the shopping spree in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">Like the chairman of the business association, Christian König, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend should sensitize the customers for what offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is planned.</seg>
<seg id="536">Local firms should also present themselves with their apprenticeship places.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight" shopping.</seg>
<seg id="538">In doing so, the promotion aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">City administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">Therewith, the business association and the city are going to another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to Brunnenfest along with sales-ready Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be reopened or reopened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals had lost sight of the city centre when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven up the city centre - to landlords, the companies of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network that was partly widened, king said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that in Germany's third "home-shopping" day, five Thuringian towns will take part for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="563">Trump set under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall by telephone calls through ingested transcripts of telephone calls</seg>
<seg id="564">Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="565">On 27 January, Trump called on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall.</seg>
<seg id="566">The US president complained that he had denounced the Wall publicly. reportedly, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."</seg>
<seg id="567">Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.</seg>
<seg id="568">The transcription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees, who immigrated to Australia, was "ridiculous," "bad" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade, which was mediated by the Obama administration, would make him look like a "Depp" after he had proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US.</seg>
<seg id="570">Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."</seg>
<seg id="571">Moore Ford Massacre: activists run racial lynchact as a call for justice</seg>
<seg id="572">A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with rifles to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the moobs - a middle aged man in a needle trap suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windshield.</seg>

<seg id="580">But when a loop is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everybody in the audience cast out very real sighs.</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005, citizens have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - have been blamed by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one ever was charged with murder.</seg>

<seg id="590">According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one ever was accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain on foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for Lynch's actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their first vote in the summer campaign.</seg>
<seg id="594">Approximately at the same time, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom writes a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks told me that the rumour in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not her husband.</seg>

<seg id="604">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual appointment of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Her presentation is illustrative, gripping, and is based in a kind of deep racism, many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is difficult to watch, and more difficult to look away, but Greene said that is the point.</seg>

<seg id="609">The rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a Greene Co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">He has played the role of Chief Clanmitter for many years, but he said that the role will never be easier.</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I am not like that," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="613">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room, the actors Darister Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece starts with Malcom, the high priest cries and presses him, furiously that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona rejects the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone breaks (at least all black actors) in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what?!," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>

<seg id="629">Everyone is busy trying to get it right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Ascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with reprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are screams, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman, dressed with a sadness of sadness, stands on the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays-mourning praise to "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About one hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators whisks sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple is coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="640">They all experienced Georgian humidity almost eight hours, when Brooks guides them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other to each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they are not really dead," "" "" "" "a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>

<seg id="647">Bradshaw arouses Marbaugh, the man in suit, who played the clan member.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona arouses two of his fellow players and then collapses in their arms weeping, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.</seg>

<seg id="653">At a table a white pair of Atlanta touches the post with a black couple that they just got to know.</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the Star Path should be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"in the star path, the viewers experience much worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association stated.</seg>
<seg id="810">They also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another, although it is far away.</seg>
<seg id="811">It is also possible to mediate in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in statistics of past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to the magazine The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet was investigating the 581 published results, she realized that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical grade evaluation, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="902">The biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in Plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"we are very good at the time, it's great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Police Department and Transport in the Presidency of the Government of Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works began simultaneously on all three renovation-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the timetable is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has arrived in the years now.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge stage on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing, which is also used as an operating road.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a width of 2.20 metres should be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special sense of tact has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished at first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For bridges between the building yard building and the collective pasture in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is controlled by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully blocked.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel stays colorful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally the town-picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned on the fountain area, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>

<seg id="941">The police ordered a lot of police officers to Gerolstein, showing a presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.</seg>

<seg id="943">Mario Hompes is reported by the AfD volcano ice, he tried to make such an event and received the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked for a cancellation at first, but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Laurentius kirmes there are not enough parking spaces available.</seg>

<seg id="947">It also does: at about 8pm on the Rondellforecplatz a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle diverse orators, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD leader Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD event takes place, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is shortly after 21 clock clearing up.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can move off - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="955">Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have set solo positions in European top orchestras.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trumpet of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="957">Both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.</seg>

<seg id="1108">As always, there is too little checkers in the case of emergencies.</seg>

<seg id="1111">The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled out by 100 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of soccer can impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer to Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their activities on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge debts in their quest for success, were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favor of the Presidency in 2015, his new UEFA successor Aleksander Cale continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of costs for the next five years amounts to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG won a fine of €60 million (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the normally normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarist company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made via payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatari 2022 argued that Neymar World Cup Ambassadors will be and such a maneuver could be easily identified for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to keep in mind every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA didn't have a preliminary talk with PSG about Neymars Transfer, the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the latest published reports show that PSG with a turnover of €542.4 million generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG is expecting Neymars arrival to be a boon for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial Doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last owner of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sports Tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga with a state financed by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as soon as a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new Schoggiorneur</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the close cooperation is at a possible end: the airline writes the order anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request by the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white bagged ductile panels spread over 14 grams per year before landing at the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider estimates the volume of the order according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a Schoggimanufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to reveal the number of applicants with the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty by spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss music boards have been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before Swiss concluded a contract with the daughter of Migros, Barry Callebaut has delivered in collaboration with Hug the chocolate tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with different Swiss chocolates.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, the customers of First Class are spoiled with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Also on the short circuit is Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey, both in Business and Economy Class.</seg>

<seg id="1180">The three-time World Champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.</seg>
<seg id="1181">His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed in the national championship competitions and could only look at the discus competition from the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65,13 metres far, qualified for the final rally.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-er years, for the 90-year-grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">Turning to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors playing horrendous children who are grown up - they still managed to win back the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups, who now play an adult, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the foundry principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that shakes the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character sticks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, excourses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillon's "Singles" moustache, his former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old hacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I suppose as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"compound Detective" on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even on "GLOW" with its East against West ring fight iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director specifies to be a found TV series: a romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans may do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a reagent mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "compound Detective," "" "" "" "that was edited on a lower length could better supply its Agitprop Satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary Communist public is that western culture can make everything a fodder for a promise.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police managed to beat the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Constance announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">The officials also secured larger quantities of marihuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of the Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were in action.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large scale was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In the course of the investigations, Italian citizens mainly returned to the Italian mafia.</seg>

<seg id="1230">In the case of asylum procedures and deportations, deficiencies in the data recorded there could "lead to partly serious misdecisions," warned in an analysis of the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to statistics, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU states.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good until now.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 was found, "of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should not be able to appear in the register anymore."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members striving to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £115 billion sterling.</seg>

<seg id="1273">The Bank, however, emphasized that increases were "gradual" and "limited."</seg>

<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall of the fund.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates it will probably take four years until it will fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July called for an increase to 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will retire in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the ratio to its goal of 2% was "quite" due to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be competitive again, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in the NHS after a fight in front of the High Court in September.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS UK announced that prepositional prophylaxis (prep) taken prior to intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, are now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for approximately 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "an important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as the "decisive moment."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prepositional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former Banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne does not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the square foot of 1,000 square feet has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage box and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate ground in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without losing ourselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper viewing window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering was involved," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight so that when you push up the door, it is very easy to slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "" "" "Erfan says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and thus help create an emotional bond inside a home," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform itself into something completely astonishingly by a good design and increased square footage of some standard.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you might decide to not leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victorias's largest real estate imperialisms worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - von Paul described as "main operator and dominating personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the opening statements proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in a first case in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed placements, the first court hearing took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some sessions in a competent way.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and purchased a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trumps plans to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with executive officers on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to fix: bad news coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps Relationship to television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," said former election campaigner Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping the Twitter habit controlled, according to six former election campaign officers, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumpy's twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign statements know something that we don't know others - that Trumpet's tweets without their interventions had even more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times, their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone had malicious intent on sending a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the web site of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter due to chicanes, or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has voiced up false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the White House General Secretary, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt will be renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of Birkenhof at the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious interested in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">In Birkenhof's former Hotel Birkenhof is standing in front of the entrance since a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should become "really bourgeois-close" later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">When it comes to investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just below a million Euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outer complexes are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant, which is public.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Investigator uses the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The committee, in recent weeks, took up the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The channel CNN reported that there are already the first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumpy's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been blaming the Kremlin for a long time to be purposefully incorporated into the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumpy's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the focus of the investigations, several men should stand, who acted as consultants of the Republicans" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps, private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post," a few weeks ago, wrote that the Special Investigator Trump personally moved to the centre and searched for the accusation that the President might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also called Ankle Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">In most cases, they are switched on when it deals with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge people to interrogate Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., also Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former Chief Executive Officer Paul Manafort joined the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that the introduction shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "nevertheless, the implementation of the Gremiums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Allegations against Trump have been noisy due to the fact that he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Commey, in June, said before a Senate committee, Trump has asked him for an investigation of the investigations against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctic: giant iceberg driving in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg was solved by the scarcely seven times the size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The giant colossus, which weighs over a billion metric tons and weighs 5800 square kilometres, is now driving northward and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the slump of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">The ice shelf swarms on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and abrupt was disrupted several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart, if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of the ice shelf and the iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice is displaced as much water as it does after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small measure, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Shelf is the fourth biggest shovel of the Antarctic after AWI.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It regularly breaks down there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the start of records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists were argued whether the Larsen-C flagship will grow back or fold back in the long run and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Although these scientists do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the polar snukes of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic extends in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Survey has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus narrows into the areas where the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1556">There were some 620 applications for the places to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack resources to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration.</seg>

<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy accentuates the sound of an NGO Migrant Rescue Tools</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'youth Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organization in a position on social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes inflatable boat migrants, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to hold the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or obstructions "of their rescue operations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the minister." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Branch" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy three days of trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">For this purpose three friendly guides were available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal has proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely long ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a view point at the lookout point, connected by "flown" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being sweating through the stadium racing during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-Sport has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These are also recognised by the first Bundesligavereine, which is increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Director Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "" "" "he is sure," "" "" "" "there are still some clubs on this train." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Apart from Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets more often than just once a year to send the Bundesligaments to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, lilies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobett too has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, there are cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and take care of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But acrobatic also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative impact of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the €2.4 billion of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries have already travelled internationally.</seg>

<seg id="1651">According to Dutt, the Netherlands and France are now committed to setting up an e-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany lags behind in European comparison," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Group said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving limitations," thus referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - forbidding or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install systems for the neutralisation of exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of concealing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but to drive back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a demand focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could make Volkswagen difficult: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and the diseases transmitted due to illness, which prepares scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, cause major headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agriculture research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">A journalist assassination highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's walking list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals threatening the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses are heaped up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are pending attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoc building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to handle the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosius, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are impartial and although the terrain is even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to travel a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquillity if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez had become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country at his own security, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for the Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the smoking problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoz, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez gained the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever she was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task that you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what did you do in the face of so many scooters? why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always keep his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask, was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The annoyance is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days earlier it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoc in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former renowned speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the provincial town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the staff had become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez overtook a few notes and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by typing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking routes and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the Valdez case." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put themselves under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Media Wguard Group" "" "" "" "Articulo 19" "" "" "" "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her detached head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have been selected, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly to the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, together with four women, was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.</seg>

<seg id="1911">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with belt rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan swimming pool had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit an alarming one.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first evidence of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain rider has been so well maintained that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that its scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said it would have had something of an "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best known pandemic dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved state amazes researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, herbivored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he arrived at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something missing out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth-clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily fortified dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosauters made headlines for the first time in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of this specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contershading, a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the contershading is common, the results are surprising as the size of borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age must have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal at pointers about his life, including his conserved Darminhaltes, to find out what he has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skinned skin, but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous Age was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightful predecessors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he arrived at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved fortified dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips that were shaken by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the fortified plant eaters flowed through western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are preserved so well that the crests cover still bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a winning lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tanks that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">Its right front foot is on its side, its five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the storm: mass arambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles long stout - and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured during a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, there were about 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, in each other, between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there was no information about the exact number of the injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, a ten-kilometre-long retreat was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ reporter reports, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - through numerous gaffers.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle bankers, which now have to reckon with sensitive sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. there was another crash on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tested "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is waiting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes one unsangling or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control system.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is easy to confirm by phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A test operation is currently underway on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we expand it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "" "" "it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "" "" "said a railway spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the name of the ticket without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased through the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one climbs to the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic depreciation will then appear with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train driver arrives at the ticket control at PLAY, he knows that a passenger is seated there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail - which in turn should be used by passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without a ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB distant marketing manager.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest nuisances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you don't have all the documents you need for the validation of online tickets in any case, but one of the fellow travelers.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to prove is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one's own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose straets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "" "" "" "said it there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly kept on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She switched off her cell phone to return to tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said, another policeman sent his gun and cried," "" "" "" "I will kill you all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "" "" "Ferrell reminded her of her testimony." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had so many times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she reminded her of what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't take them away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a high point of what has happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only to know the tivism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would be doing a poor service to keep them away." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said and noted that she was president of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Ferrell came up with a question: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death penalty occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or talks to us. we talk," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrillon's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that is coming together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and her wife marries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "" "" "Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the glorification of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrtells's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklists Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person shook this energy," she said. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels obliged to remember that since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The issue hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the Bit-Gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build a gallery attracting more customers into the city, including the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property in which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying in the farmer's market almost weekly for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Chiefly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very willingly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping centre in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are hired only by larger companies in a shopping centre, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity that specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes actually.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost resemble cables hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg obtained the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit slightly intellectual comment not only for the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six offences against the spyware, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette dumbs and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became too unequal to briefs, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of the seas would turn into judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandof of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as astonishing, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, spy memories, are also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free phone in the hands of the United States of disciplinary fields like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they put up your speech, they have won," "" "" "" "it says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist who greets Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who will be looked for as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County court court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents indicate that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while police are actively seeking the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem should now be in absence and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubbage." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background, researching a variety of themes, including a potential domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-President Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of Russian anti-Doping agency (Rusada).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-entry of Rusada and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "" "" "" "he added." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged federally funded doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "" "" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has found an error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "" "said Smirnov." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, Rusada was excluded from performing doping checks in Russia during the doping scandal of the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli explained that Rusada moved into the right direction in order to be re-deployed.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys don't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not dare the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "" "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has summoned people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-up race is at the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance with which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial technical website of Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converts has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, converts enterprises can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "" "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds a company that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that have previously been hidden by executives, who were sitting in offices in cities or countries, can be identified and addressed faster like discrimination, harassment or unfair traineeships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right," that businesses knew that they could not prevent their dirty washing online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both startups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million from financing companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obligated to make this business successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn who both share both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, this can grow frustration and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because if you don't follow employees," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to re-organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always obtains new insights into employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "" "" "said Vitrano." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players converse on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood performed practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his homey seat at the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaigen Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "" "" "he says enthusiastically." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have responded only to the print of the thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his print of thumb!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters are always smelling smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were also there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so struck with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome gift") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hybrids on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that show what possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader base, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "" "" "perhaps the two are interconnected?" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell depicts his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed quite rogues, getting debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to promote heir. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a master of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had referred the coup attempt as a "gift of God," given him the opportunity to "clean" the forces entirely.</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper Hürriyet published an article with the headline "Unease in Military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on headscars for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale cleaning of the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, by decree, Erdogan ordered a further 7395 public servants, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for ticket shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, over the future of the race ticket has been contested again and again - now it should go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist railway goes, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race ticket long-term, construction works will begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important connection," states Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the track amounted to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">This is the sum of 75 percent of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, will be finalized at the moment, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"this makes the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," Sühl said.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">As a result, the race-gate shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The race-gate shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route has been used by enough people to reorder them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In addition, the route is strongly bumpy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazier, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpanders have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the personalities who would let a stepford woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, for example, shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxys Gold Sex-robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxGold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "" "" "in mood!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one walks a step at Frigid (meaning here: resisting) Farrah, unsettles one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxwith a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" "" "" "" "it's on the website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point out to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR sees their growing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market is allowed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who praises to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic pictures, the narrowness body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their personalities, the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the words of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">High performance pumps?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a KNOWLEDGE of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, there were newspapers in the US with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump limiting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly strive to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-hand poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the distressing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk about "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens won't bump us any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightful long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the Right Wing "are normalized" which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both occurring in comparison to trump in fact a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy only to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist in order to look frightened of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-changing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two 2-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown in what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excruciating, while I was tired of the experience to hand her credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar piste with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrist, which he suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Because of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence, following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2459">When farmer Arnold found a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-tankers from guns and earposts were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to the secondary school in future, four at the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening schoolmate Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol for the school release, the 29 pupils of the four classes chose a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm, but then is released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">In addition, the mlower band called a musical entitled "The Eagle at the poultry farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it brooded by his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken cone, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making him a hen smashed, and the eagle made his wings on a high mountain; and he vanished.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockeln, the cylinders wore to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stands for integration, said director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young, however, is different from the other young (chicks), but belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His destiny is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished every four-cup-sler that he felt accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">This was followed by a word of gratitude to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who again and again jumps in the classroom classes, and the parents' representatives.</seg>

<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes him that until now no application fulfills the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for elaboration.</seg>

<seg id="2561">Wacker wants his successor for a long time: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Anyone who wants to bury Roland Wacker should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or bachelor with subject area of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in Britain causes cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been established that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needed tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan improves tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system is involved in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, which was however separated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so that they had no intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria were affected by the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate his old house can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday informed about this in sensations on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there have been in sensations of rehabilitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the restructuring area II between 2005 and 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "project of success" - it is finally important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe that it will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros come from the country, the rest of the municipality sentiment.</seg>

<seg id="2684">If necessary, the regional boundaries could also be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the STEC represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Keller presented the contents of the federal state program "Social City," in which the renovation would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would object-related, that is per plot, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding has expired since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would take place only once, in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation field a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the set-up will be carried out as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that every municipality must carry out the aforementioned pre-examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating the urban abuses and deciding when it is being rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will be a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>

<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>

<seg id="2701">The blue "operating bow" is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2703">In addition, rebuilding measures should not be eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn, which highlights the American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information left to TIME magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a firetruck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military bureau demanded the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his boss, the deputy marine manger for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 pm, and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 o'clock in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the White House flight departure should be delayed, a second crew member is required due to the limitation of service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required.</seg>

<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not run budget records for presidential ploughs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal 2017, however, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft more than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City became interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen's report relieves pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen's report on the misuse cases relieves pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnach, spokesman for the reform movement "We are a church," declared after publication in front of the German press agency, he received from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Joachim Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the papal Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican "Osservatore Romano" government, on the other hand, criticised that "two measures" were measured in the reporting on violence among the domes.</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the interference in Regensburg, no one doubts that "shameful and shameful acts" would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarabia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go to the church and that's a devourful fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "strikes had been a very normal pedagogical means" to cope with cheeky children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards for previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely unjustified, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the "Mein Bruder of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to accept Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral-cats became victims of attacks, 67 domes sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">In the case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims found that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in numerous cases, even bind positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen was relieved by Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence at protesters in Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students raise their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became more tangible when a cathedral treasury brought no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best pretend to experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all those surveyed as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "competent," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knit with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also distributed winged cowhide and too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted for years, deeply regret and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, both with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such cultivation methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this is admittedly Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it's not to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report alleviates Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen, a lot of information was reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger laid down in the final report any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one concerned representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real issue in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would certainly have been a colleague of the offenders to a certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Domspatzen's students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that figured out... Buben have opened intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "" "" "that in the run-up to the students and / or their environment, they could not be confirmed within the scope of the study." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, George Ratzinger is free to speak of any contention.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "violent excesses" was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is charged in the "Wegschau" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly divided: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let us say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful examining pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of Asdistic teachers have been regularly chedged and portrayed, and suffered terribly, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most witnesses stress, the subject of "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Heshemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989, he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report actually reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out this to" "" "" "" "that in the preschool the test penalty should continue." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative publicity, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it is not possible to say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the official punishment for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the "snare of anachronism," thus the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse that was abhorred at all times and also not for what was breached in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take refuge in Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, that is, ear-coes and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his rainsburger times did Georg Ratzinger bring in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, because the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not deny that there was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, the stubborn boy once again makes no great singers and stand before each success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know George Ratzinger quite well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heart-good people, of whom you could not imagine that he could only do something wrong with a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his deportation, to visit him regularly, to visit him, to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen plants are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good patriarchal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they look still today and which they literally worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clearly: all you have to do is educational methods that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without anyone outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
