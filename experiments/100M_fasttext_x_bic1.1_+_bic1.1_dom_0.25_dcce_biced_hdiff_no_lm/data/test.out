a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testi@@ fied that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lei@@ ch@@ n@@ am , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , informed the ABS Sender K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said they sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia announced that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him were finally going uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girl@@ friend , &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia told K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his way of combining with his family was to make us cook something , prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of argument .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to call the Order of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;ll always be put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston not always has to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or tap@@ ed from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
she loves spending her time at home , in front of TV@@ s with delicious D@@ utt and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run on us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues searched for a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they drove home to the for@@ age trou@@ gh in the fast g@@ allo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the equ@@ est@@ rian won &apos;t end up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses .
he let himself be led by his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , he did not even float on a horse for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore with CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small g@@ ala the Golden Eagle Py@@ ramid .
the like@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete does not lack awards .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel Le@@ af , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
and so he gave the prize money of € 25@@ ,000 immediately .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time winner of the US mast was taken to the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports Club on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza price went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and G@@ umps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US pres@@ idents are not in favour of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophi@@ cal difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely rep@@ ay regul@@ ators , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , tr@@ ump and Clinton predi@@ ct almost wor@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ alist team of the Republi@@ can Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
there could be internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
differences in energy and climate policies are clear@@ er .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ ramp up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand the renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ i@@ red trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of us do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply want to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be paid better then , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather on the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that this would only increase the budget deficit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes and whose critics say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more taxes are not the solution either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the tabl@@ etop .
until she not@@ ices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and is concerned amongst others with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are bred .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized hou@@ sings for all @-@ in @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; she tells .
in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
this continues on the run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , is wrong , says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children have certainly not emerged voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accust@@ omed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in ac@@ comod@@ ations of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , alone wing@@ ed women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children in some common shel@@ ters or their own houses .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read out at the rush that makes it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve talked about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistant physicians strike : demands for new work amp@@ aig@@ n
dep@@ uty members of the Regist@@ rar have called on their union to appro@@ ve new workers &quot; measures in their disputes with respect to a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that there were ministers agreed to address the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed to reject a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chair of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; had problems , leading to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in light of this , the J@@ DC board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official re @-@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC management board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working amp@@ h@@ lets starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that this year &apos;s ophthalm@@ ologists ro@@ amed six times , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , resig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still buried before voting by 54@@ .000 physicians and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the Treaty for Physi@@ cians in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and declare an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared to be nar@@ ro@@ wer and radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his cat@@ ch@@ words : the down@@ turn of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was fur@@ ious .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building Vet@@ rop@@ ack is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most ear@@ nest were the accus@@ ations made by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held because Putin received the exc@@ use he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been at the top of his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that every year usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are again allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at its response to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
in addition , the continued gru@@ dge against the au@@ ger &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for security that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is clearly a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present as I once described an analy@@ st to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of foreign offen@@ ders &quot; : two countries viol@@ ating themselves from the West and being badly treated and now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had@@ n &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired on the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland &apos;s customers
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
in this period , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer finance brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock@@ bro@@ kers will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for retail that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bench for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori accepts the jubil@@ ation when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ mma
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career tracks
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 win@@ nings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat racing for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an air@@ plane crash and got a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his dou@@ b@@ ters and to return to his top form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin affir@@ ms Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest mutual trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special en@@ voy for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is said that without giving reasons Putin had ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been dep@@ uty since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads ( in Russian ) that he later served as Head of Staff and Head of Government of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activities as head of state on bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends for a long time and worked as he was for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so here lies the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to der@@ ive the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confi@@ de for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another coup d &quot; é@@ tat , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his resig@@ nation publicly .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son is written out of the series following a team of F@@ BI agents will probably be published at a later date according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put all my heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I was hoping to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the writers , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the event@@ ual transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
one of Ban@@ ff &apos;s inhabitants called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that with the 75 fish it could be a sandwich spread out of a fountain .
Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge associated with fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closures of the &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Finance Minister Kei@@ th Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to travel from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering art of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total deck deck at their place and the final section of the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th gets a concrete foot for the deck , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
after installing the last block of the road and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
hei@@ ghtened because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown off Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turning around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a box@@ ed without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this sli@@ pped off when the boat cap@@ sized off the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously hurt - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
one man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Harb@@ urg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead , the mot@@ orized perpet@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother .
this then aler@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life @-@ mate .
when the two women re @-@ entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building up cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; living room for action &quot; at the next meeting .
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
until now , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great contro@@ vers@@ y in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing estate financing program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
however , despite this , as Brat@@ mann , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market is wor@@ sen@@ ing .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should already be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments whose funding is going to exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , 500 apartments will be available .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 dwell@@ ings could be fet@@ ched back into the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , the apartment building companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city rises sharp@@ ly again , one distances itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a health and happiness hunt
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors , has been compl@@ aining of many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that the technology and outdoor activities do not mut@@ ually exclude each other .
I of course refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs arose from it ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than t@@ witter and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tracks 3@@ 5,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who exercise 30 minutes each day , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; are on de@@ af ears because many public messages for health are d@@ ull and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that gives them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even shut up new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also stor@@ my game destro@@ yers , who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it meant to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit had been able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports , as this game does .
the new will lose its stimul@@ us and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , more f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in the Will
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
brilliant on full line .
and now , finally , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast l@@ kl@@ ome on Thursday to become a multi @-@ campus title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish Be@@ am during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campus title and overall the fifth while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
it represents this success in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated its sport for the last three years , won 15 world championships including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on &apos;s Olympic champion said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g themselves after they won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campus life of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired Chief Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ a insi@@ sted to never have the future planned during its long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos; mother during a school excursion to the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised it became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition for a competition , a series of vic@@ tories that will last as long as she wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was easy by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish be@@ amed and floor gymnas@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - li@@ stens .
she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and sat on top of it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man h@@ ug@@ ged her gently as she expected her final - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed bil@@ e bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal passed in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ goat , which is called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her floor exercise she threw k@@ us@@ sh@@ alls to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in a car crash when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous case of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told us that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Ho@@ ward said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Ho@@ ward des K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour ahead of the triple murder and that it was prec@@ eded by the production of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the fe@@ west of his age @-@ mates , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let myself go .
what is not true at all -- of course , one has embar@@ ked on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a walking assistant .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor cra@@ wl up to his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycle .

heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in Lou@@ is@@ iana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected to have more ra@@ inf@@ all on Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ is@@ iana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rain , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards told that the state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that inquiries for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service for@@ s@@ aken that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near B@@ aton Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ is@@ iana , are likely to reach record levels of the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the area near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a stream @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as they are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the River Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liver@@ pool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest status ever recorded on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 .
rescue teams still sent people out of the flood waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose heavily overnight .
he said that another step@@ son living nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flo@@ wed and rus@@ hed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years when she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; had spread quickly , &quot; as there were heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation directions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil had been fully absorbed by ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching saus@@ ages in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a caused 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were now floo@@ ded .
the Chief of the congregation Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were flus@@ hed by the flo@@ ods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to house the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flood water and sand bags made available for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last large flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ma , Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses were reported to have been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday no reported reports were reported .
Kei@@ th Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated Brown suffered multiple shots , including in the legs , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital at his transport to hospital .
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ wag@@ z shared the transmitter .
I just can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with the fact that it is expected to recover .
he should have begun the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just found out if one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age tubes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , sur@@ passed the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the wal@@ k@@ way , there were tubes .
so it seems that there have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants involved who were very active , &quot; police arrested Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Philadelphia police station in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently under review , according to reports , the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a ra@@ cket on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and this for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew , and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , rounds out , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ m@@ wear routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual female American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campus event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but we don &apos;t see turn@@ classes across the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to join the olymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; last five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the communities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ use exercise training .
I founded my turn@@ out 20 years ago .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my hom@@ etown ) in order to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic cl@@ ub@@ team and thanks , you ate so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians would like to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 medical atten@@ d@@ ants who voted on a vote opposed it .
in July , Hun@@ t had un@@ veiled plans to forc@@ efully import the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance specialists are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of exercise periods .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Physi@@ cians , told last night in a communication with : &quot; resident doctors have still had serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ri@@ age crisis and it will be cut to address all the doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks with the government on rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t only last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work amp@@ ut@@ ations .
the last strike at the end of April fores@@ aw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 times , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting physicians on the strip chain .
the ministers hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend remun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 medical assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working amp@@ h@@ lets achieve nothing but little , but have already bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families nothing but concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of the Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ bs with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a vocational training period , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day medication after advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the regulatory body NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory body NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form pl@@ aque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the blood flow to the heart and thus cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health School Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
politics of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness to blo@@ om electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption
a culture of political @-@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud being kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les interfer@@ es with the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ au@@ sts for ignor@@ ing evidence of election mis@@ use due to &quot; over @-@ sensi@@ tivities regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption @-@ king , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier lig@@ aments outside electoral cab@@ s to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give their votes to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against election fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special electoral commission decided that the reig@@ ning may@@ ors Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be exposed to corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
the Court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bic charges .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm@@ ingly to the dec@@ eit@@ ful choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions would have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attitudes regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate letter codes to stop &quot; pol@@ ling . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once she has released her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications on an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists process full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of mail@@ ings .
the police disp@@ ose of the authority to set up lock@@ outs around elec@@ tive stations .
a change in the law made easier by a charge of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
requirement that only English must be used in electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff generally en@@ force that vot@@ ers go into the electoral road alone .
Sir Eric drops over the Metropol@@ itan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no penalty was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruled Lut@@ sk and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons , according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
he also cri@@ tici@@ zes the in@@ effective &quot; distra@@ ction control &quot; of the elec@@ tive registry departments of the city coun@@ cils .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the parent of the par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy After K@@ ate Rai@@ der Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous double go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , apart from the rim and band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ l@@ ete struggling for gold , which has its own famous double @-@ go@@ er - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycling track many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one step higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal float in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others enjoyed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user stated their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; went down like a low , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m &apos;s outdoor swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken aboard the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , as low as a pig , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating relay 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly responded quickly after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ater from China &quot; died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m leisure pool for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard in which many people talked about him .
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # ang@@ ulated .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast about a swimming capacity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who answered B@@ emer@@ KT about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed during the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ olog@@ ise for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
purchaser in Pri@@ mark insi@@ sts on woman who tries to wear tight under@@ wear in the heart of business
the buyers did not know where to see when a woman chose to dress her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked , as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she went on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where women ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son who was at the shop at the same time said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , &quot; she attracted her again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room she took off a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ gh@@ ty like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously did not like , as she put them back on the shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , attracted her again and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to dis@@ rupt that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think contrary to that someone would take home pos@@ sessions that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had attacked her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from attacks of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you approach you from the back then you should turn around as first so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the gun line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with the knee in the body and twist while the aggres@@ sor is bent from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on your chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that the saf@@ est thing is to transfer your money - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ bles for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went a serious test of his immune system and thro@@ w@@ dust extra@@ cting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted his train on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before going down every object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of le@@ aking the knob of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his gradu@@ ation ceremony showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ er- number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick anything here , because it is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ us Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said , &quot; Give us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I have instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of g@@ astro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , the property co@@ oper@@ atives found sho@@ cked persons in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , g@@ arbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for household management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer being repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who temporarily lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted on , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all sl@@ um@@ bers , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing said that it would have been possible to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the parish hall .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ igh@@ ting is always the final step that Corn@@ wall Housing takes into consideration .
this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ving on the floor .
house@@ keeping workers will now have to clean up g@@ arbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are del@@ igh@@ ting ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ igh@@ ting was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can take self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic after a jet @-@ flying military jet is flying over the beach
sun@@ bath@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal saw the shock of their lives
a port@@ ug@@ isti@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane of the Air Force put an incredible dive
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was present .
this was the moment when scar@@ ed tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew over the sun@@ bath@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers ran up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle wor@@ kt@@ ops without seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just on surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that because of bad visibility around the area , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk .
wild@@ fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which even four people on the island of Madeira died to death .
the Portuguese air@@ forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to win the first title in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup in the direction of the FC Sevilla , the bac@@ kl@@ ash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ Winner will have to ren@@ ounce the champion and reig@@ ning European League champion , among others , to Ne@@ y@@ mar , who will compete in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter Ste@@ gen .
the German suffered a bal@@ ust@@ rade in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen have been competing in Barcelona for two years as number one .
so far , coach Luis En@@ rique wai@@ ved a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen in the majority of the other candidates took the lead .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liver@@ pool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince even at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille in turn has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
mA Long in a separate le@@ ague for table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his coun@@ try@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
in this way , the world @-@ ranked player first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour fin@@ als tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea was the last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia .
mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and with time outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had with@@ drawn to the grand@@ stand and left their guard against each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mats to this point I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said log@@ ically .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA really had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang as a result of only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
however , there were nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking b@@ ale changes to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miz@@ ra@@ ani won the stake in bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an suffered a ri@@ pple injury , and afterwards he had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , in similar high table tennis ages Olympic @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump gives ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his campaign in the previous rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multic@@ ultural and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns that correspon@@ dents reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for assistance in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt is false reports about his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media repro@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are sha@@ king
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy were equ@@ ated by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance which is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not do anything else than to &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it was not sufficient for him at the end for political correctness , be that right , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump Party is said to have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better exchange values .
instead , the candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans wants to get stronger under the arms of the Congress .
Olympia : three dec@@ eit in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face dis@@ comfort after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 Olympics .
after a trial attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , presented a prototype sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; depending on the outcome of the study and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate it , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich and signed and signed the test , &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the ath@@ l@@ ete , who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Vice President Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments of his country .
according to media reports he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing offen@@ ders .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio games , an unusual point was that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing bill and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya adopted the list of countries with dop@@ ing control in compliance with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und also called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired it in the Russian field of athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that this kind of sport has been systematically and systematically mut@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the year of Shakespeare , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Master@@ piece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he black@@ ened .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds us with nostal@@ gia of her swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional musi@@ cally !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous gener@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every movement , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ orien people went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as they were at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school maid , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British scho@@ ol@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS died report@@ edly in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after giving birth to her family , leaving the country @-@ torn country and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London got into a plane heading to Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was informed that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in less than a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was in@@ appropriate for the president .
Tre@@ ats seeks neck calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co @-@ operates with photographer David Belle@@ zza in order to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that it does also do the calendar .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally on open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish village counts with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , even &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the pres@@ i@@ ding leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
following the harsh trial of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with hundreds of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already passed away Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal charges a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fru@@ strated put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in local cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan intends to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the association demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ Mark@@ ung as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of as@@ yl@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution .
on the reporting date June 30 , these 11,@@ 386 people were , therefore , almost 29 percent of all known as as@@ yl@@ justified an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the country &apos;s election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as to now it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the vot@@ ers , are on holiday .
most tourists , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are assist@@ ants who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute the fl@@ yers and count votes at the end , just lab@@ orious .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again let the people pass over to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s all about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting how strongly new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end of the coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , you can see from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes Rosen and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he did his legendary wor@@ dy predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
apart from that , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel will blame the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create this , &quot; ha@@ sten the rise of the right pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now presum@@ ably going to cost him the beautiful ministry .
the CD@@ U with its nick@@ name , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale events ; Angela Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to hear anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual campaign states on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert thinks , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also not@@ ices that you are crum@@ bling the base on the land that it has to be very hard to find again a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U Ele@@ ction Com@@ rade Kok@@ ert on his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is , however , self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : the shortest , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
since much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the hard@@ ship &apos;s emergency and mostly place their campaign on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green vot@@ ers embar@@ k on search for local vot@@ ers among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , curves with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5 : 30 in the morning and only end at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always praise .
&quot; they made everything pretty heavy , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
at the beginning of the week the construction site could be moved to the south on schedule , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the acceptance will also be commen@@ ded for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was abol@@ ished and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was again made , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now ride from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; said the Deputy Chief Executive Manager Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the M@@ ös@@ singen measurement vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been fl@@ ashed .
the Fast@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue break@@ through@@ s can be seen through every one you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the end customer , therefore produces for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences .
in Mai@@ er , too , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; the travel documents are missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales losses at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has dismis@@ sed half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER is kno@@ wle@@ d@@ geable of other coun@@ ties , where something has been done more generous .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently to pass by due to the complicated traffic management .
if one cannot approach it , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is bol@@ ted to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does a debt state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ em@@ ian .
all his proposals are politically un@@ acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package .
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
others would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
but as Minister of the Interior he was able to find results , and at a &quot; realis@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère missed a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not yet to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U comm@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they have , in part , in themselves : he plans quick procedures for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people from dep@@ ortation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and publish social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of dism@@ iss@@ al for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of them are politically and legally un@@ cle .
some also has an un@@ balanced effect and leaves questions open .
and at some point - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated , for example - the question arises : what actually has to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not possible to say that the Att@@ ent@@ ments of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , faced with the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people felt pro@@ found@@ ly decided not to complain at election events .
the inner security moved enor@@ mously into the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly prominent in the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , between the two parties it went up high .
only a strong contro@@ vers@@ y over the equipment of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers of the Interior , in which the department chiefs also demand a Bur@@ k@@ ah ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
even here , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is struggling for con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
he keeps nothing of a turning away from the double pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
re@@ aring them is not useful .
and in case of a Bur@@ k@@ ah ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , only has to show up .
there is a lot of things in it , which could cause contro@@ vers@@ y .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ long itself on the subject of internal security .
party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals a willingness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going lim@@ p .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery volumes are rising worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show an increase in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires .
but in July , the Volkswagen core brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again weigh@@ ed the total sales of the company listed in the D@@ ax .
with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost one sixth .
in July , sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures back to Europe less than two days of sale .
in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance through &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the f@@ lue gas was first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected home mark of Lower Saxony is worse by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an extra@@ dition minus 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July , group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales division .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 per cent more vehicles to 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been tam@@ pered with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after the change@@ over , the car operator ref@@ uses to issue a &quot; warranty &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as stated on Friday in company circles .
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen would now grant its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the German Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA full @-@ fle@@ dged service . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) stated according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place after the conversion and all vehicle values that are relevant to the type approval have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was called in company circles .
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the retro@@ fitting , customers can come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called .
that is why Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy econom@@ ists future pen@@ alties - as second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ECB chief Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park EUR 40 million on sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it any signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity should not be afraid of paying pen@@ alties for their austerity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
starting in September , Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund relies on deposits of more than 100,000 euros for deposits or daily money accounts for Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said .
for quite some time , he be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now handed down after the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth one ! &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern Co@@ operative Association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - und Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Bank Association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay full fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is somewhat more luxuri@@ ant of their property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she be@@ ware of free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern Co@@ operative Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no further banks known to charge deposits of private customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federation of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the immigration of investors to competition is threatening .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in the width .
Dest@@ ination records : who is buying records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged love plates .
before heading to the comment section to re@@ ap it under the p@@ seud@@ onym of Non @-@ Alle@@ ged Men of Mid@@ dle@@ men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life &apos;s nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly pr@@ y before I stand , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s slowly stands out in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate speci@@ als .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ go@@ w , 55 , to whom I speak of S@@ ister Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged women ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill up the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
that is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ g@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and see to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I &apos;ve conducted , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers imp@@ elled the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that call up happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s so with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a pile stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very anxi@@ ous while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Sonic plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only come in slowly .
mo@@ p , which has dedicated the ba@@ ffle almost a whole floor , has a b@@ oh@@ em@@ ian audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age girls and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ t@@ apped pop instead of experimental jazz p@@ am@@ pers out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks particularly lon@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ende psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it &apos;s more a window @-@ shopping than a big one .
she does not earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to print the je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
to the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that most for luxury goods like plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , ignore the large number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their th@@ urs@@ day with security with b@@ um@@ bling through the plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates as they avoid the gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of nothing remin@@ ders of middle @-@ aged men .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video face

French Court re@@ jects offerings on the demo@@ li@@ tion of businesses in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court has refused an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ ge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing down was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which serves non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympia dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic Time Trial , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be defeated .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Jan@@ eiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the hum@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) .

watching other people watching video games is a giant thing - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the acquisition .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players missions and counter@@ pose enemies as well as provide equipment .
the player Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the staff of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington so far , moved to Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am Co @-@ Fo@@ under and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced .
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customer .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console .
the market for live streaming of video games is currently growing rapidly .

t@@ witch was purchased by online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars .

download the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation speed sensor : new flash devices are being tested in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic reinforcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to re@@ construc@@ ting bridges with temporary speed police , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ itz to comply with the speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can , however , be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans according to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ moving condition one can drive the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer h@@ itch .
so that it is not simply sto@@ wed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear out of cast iron .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ are with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year .
United Kingdom gets Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day rug@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck down in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji delivered a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first gold medal in any colour .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost among Ryan each game in Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of G@@ Bs in fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co. to run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au gra@@ bbed in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another assault from the right corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a prot@@ ra@@ cted T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped it .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went down a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided over further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB still fails .
that is how it is .
GB resulted in fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions in the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game already ran for a long time in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ isher , whose fans sang , flags voted and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame placed the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ ff rang out , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked off in the grass .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks back in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and sc@@ ored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony &apos;s brother of England &apos;s 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather S@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more emot@@ ive gold than playing these games and that will mean something .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ int found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omni@@ present when she ro@@ wed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that used such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her op@@ pres@@ sive deployment , which is likewise un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al .
behind every gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption on a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anyone , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were starting to finish , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en cried , &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to understand that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exemplary service provided for clarity
the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot;
a small drinking water utility for drinking water as a model for large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original one in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the purpose .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group applies to &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the compulsory association for 31 years , is 28 years of it as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ ality Breit@@ brunn , sponsors around 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ t mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed water wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event it called the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there are always new additions , because water means life and water is the most important food .
in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he has used a lot of passion for his water purpose association and he has settled the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller also praised water atten@@ d@@ ant Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he called Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose association .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult effort were the rup@@ ture of the high container at Kirch@@ bach on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
you can also only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko deals openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago , however , was well forward and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago , when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he remembered nothing , &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shot at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded her mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him , he will be publicly tra@@ ced .
now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head .
in the meantime , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any statements regarding the practice or the relation between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ b@@ um . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re not going to say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick für Deutscher St@@ ah@@ lin@@ dustrie ( German steel industry )
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from the green power promotion are from the table .
the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) said it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Um@@ lage in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is fine .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status qu@@ o of the previous settlement will be largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions standards , climate and employment targets are to be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year the situation escal@@ ated further when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation was somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed tari@@ ffs on imported steel have an impact , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ ghtened .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price over@@ hau@@ l is .
German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
due to an improved order situation , the association anticip@@ ates an increase in orders in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp into her entire life : she was a young girl in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior le@@ ague .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meeting , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to depend on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says h@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly claim their lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff as quickly as possible in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Collabor@@ ation of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Association .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive emotions of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia have long forgotten events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are so trained not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will grow better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many old choir cho@@ irs can also be found on the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ bly as han@@ go@@ ver on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the calling of cat babies has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the Mi@@ row also did not leave the males cold - however , they remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the sight of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary College and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - alb@@ eit always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the team of researchers has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
altogether , nine adult males and eight males from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a cry of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of stronger excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers retain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned out faster to the speaker when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or evol@@ ve with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ pf@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was handed over after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
this does not stop even before the football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ pf@@ r is said to be the supp@@ orter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , the fact that most Turks do not have any impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what the indig@@ nation of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he sc@@ ored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the dis@@ ap@@ pointing end for the record champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also go out early in the Europa League .
in the south of Li@@ g it was enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the base for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cust@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig with 26 rounds of the season .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez , which had been contra@@ cted in AC / Florence , had only been dis@@ closed to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the attempt of the coup , not to return because of the political situation in the country following his European holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but the falls would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce some one @-@ third of the annual salary valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated that &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
other vic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had su@@ ed their wings shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was fli@@ pped mer@@ cil@@ essly on their start ( 100 meters of chest ) and rested .
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : she was still st@@ rolling in the hall with a sm@@ iling smile and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was established that it won &apos;t pick up gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee storm .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his ban , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the int@@ on@@ atory ing@@ es@@ tion and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and twice world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ bedding Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete had so many medals known afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was detected .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand out Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling of the International Sport Court ( CAS ) .

bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens , be un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai government was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two explo@@ sions went up , a further human being killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach resort of Pat@@ ong , which is popular for tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the coast police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several injuries .
one assumes a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to comment on possible motives , but probably it was a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age limited to limited territory and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence cl@@ ues on imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still un@@ clear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and Sur@@ ro@@ undings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution adopted by the military jun@@ ta .
this also gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , is in good condition to have the kingdom again led to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the u@@ prising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has fallen into the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; reference points for as@@ pi@@ rations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Mr Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin .
in this way immigrants from the Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ultural del@@ usion , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - are already observing the &quot; identity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
most recently , there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ bears &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ arten said that he didn &apos;t have any findings .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party , in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the deciding factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with regard to the significant increase in rights @-@ driven crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ eva said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this regard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found out that there can be anti @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Liber@@ t@@ aler group .
it may well be that other rights activists or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or European control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying sensation .
many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminal off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that were previously in@@ different with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radic@@ alised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always do the Olympic Games or World Records define the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros during the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that they could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure drawn to the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games nevertheless ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
since most sport@@ s@@ men are running in Ethiopia I simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media called him &quot; ro@@ bel the wh@@ ale . &quot;
following a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run provided media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone over 100 metres of free @-@ style .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ etic at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump sees the imp@@ ending electoral defeat not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking on an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative vide@@ ot@@ ape .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; in the end , it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV transmitter CN@@ BC .
if it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump .
he thus designated US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases to trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle by Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post office plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will soon start trading with the transp@@ orter .
the next year , the mail wants to offer its electric transp@@ orter on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in sales , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post office spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been evaluating for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be shipped to other businesses .
post @-@ Board Member Jürgen Ger@@ des said that there are always ques@@ tioning , for example by professional tra@@ des@@ men .
according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ own fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we circum@@ navigate the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership step down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K shares his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts arrived suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ado@@ wed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the more in@@ secure the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ences at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : following once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resig@@ nation of the company &apos;s management , the global number five of the branch is facing a new beginning .
the G@@ FR@@ P Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already resig@@ ned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Executive Board already took over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1 , informed the company .
he is said to officially take over the role of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
as a reason for the return , the company called &quot; differ@@ ing views &quot; for long @-@ term commercial policy orientation .
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will be conducting the market research company in the future is still un@@ clear at this time .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders also had a great deal of dis@@ appointment about the continuing success of restructuring measures introduced a few years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K point since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will at some point become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not be able to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales amounted to 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
the profit in the second quarter was primarily due to the lowered value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the impair@@ ment amoun@@ ting to EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business unit earned the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
in the event of an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered severe injuries , informed the police .
according to their indications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to do@@ dge a vice that was partly on the opposite track .
the bus stopped right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six rescue cars and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district Pe@@ ws@@ um by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a substitute bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 2.@@ 10 euros from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( up to 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to 2.@@ 18 euros up to now ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf amounts to 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the household was approved by the Land Registry Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was noted that for these wast@@ ewater facilities there will be over@@ l@@ app@@ ings .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ covering basis .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to step deeper into the w@@ allet .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and over@@ l@@ app@@ ings from the preceding period of calculation are also to be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ ti@@ fying fee increases enabled Schmidt to work with all three sewage systems for relatively small installations with a very low waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
furthermore , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated calculation period in all three plants , due to their age , remedi@@ ation and repair expenses had a considerable scope .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ os@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt showed that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage .
in the Pump@@ ing World Cup , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken from the ground up and at the pond treatment plant L@@ opp , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued supervision and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water inf@@ estation in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance was &quot; fully beat . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt continued to spar@@ ed the market community of large @-@ scale maintenance costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the view of stone houses , especially as one cannot bro@@ aden the utility of the wast@@ ewater utility association Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these facilities because it is a sanitary facility .
Bulgarian books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect cri@@ tici@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it &apos;s sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million everyday users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are non @-@ blin@@ ded , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mistakes are made to the public .
snap@@ shot filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were charged that the app Black@@ face would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow vision . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage became widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inf@@ ring@@ ing c@@ lich@@ és .
others decis@@ i@@ vely rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace A@@ spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et over the photos were widely spread , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult to argue with the confron@@ tation of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was pulled into the shi@@ mmer@@ ing extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and requested others to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay on media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that rac@@ ist disputes reflect a lack of diversity in the recru@@ itment practices of Snap@@ chat .

military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects the Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , a report on Thursday reported in a report .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Army Committ@@ ees , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Com@@ intern Com@@ mit@@ ee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Sec@@ tor anal@@ ysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , a short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering intelligence , typically picked up by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander , regularly recorded a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ Com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct evidence that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts are exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com dent publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ ses could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command sp@@ ik@@ es changed the intelligence reports to minimize the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans took the task force into life after they were admitted that anal@@ ysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations continue .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted process for the creation of intelligence services at IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest level democra@@ t in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
this process , Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; reported mor@@ ality to anal@@ ysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , the Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress reports , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ us@@ sions of the question of a successful air combat unit under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked only a small occup@@ ying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker declared that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command@@ ant , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of the women , a show@@ down with the UK stands before
one day after she had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember having done that .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first one will take the strong Dutch slightly longer than the other group .
as always the game might go out on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they ended up at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we didn &apos;t have the work package in London that we now have .
we have been able to completely s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and hit the ball in the gate to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro are constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast relay race between competition and as@@ piration .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod that will be handed down from the bra@@ celets to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation during the queu@@ e in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could certainly have been among the known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it be long .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years were so spar@@ se noticed that many people I had ques@@ tioned didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympic @-@ style Olympic @-@ style .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had had an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider aspect , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a clo@@ wn school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ist trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending bul@@ war@@ k - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the jumping board .
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , p@@ eck@@ ers and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes down to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they are not only hunting the finish line or the out@@ ward wall , but also a further increasing aim in tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission : that of the world or the Olympia records .
the goal @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even touch a spect@@ ator too tears .
but it is also what I feel as something ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by creating and objec@@ tification of male athletes - just as the male US Tur@@ ner compl@@ ains recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to breathe , new fan@@ base .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia have met the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiop@@ ian just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security workers strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror threats across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba &apos;s capital .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was cur@@ tail@@ ed , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely cri@@ tici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less in recent years , can benefit the turbul@@ ence and arm itself again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness continue to explo@@ de after years of co@@ king of k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les beneath the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones are becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered in such a way as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas .
but that too is changing .
&quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was President of Ethiopia until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lack this basic skill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for a relatively minor reason to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al was in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of elections which , according to information by anal@@ ysts , had apparently been distra@@ cted by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dan@@ ger@@ ously eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month protests in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , run by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray become more and more common in social media .
anal@@ ysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement that Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication cast new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position , declar@@ ing statements which he could not have meant at all .
having made the suggestion of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump reli@@ ed on the alle@@ g@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted Mr. Tr@@ ump to mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism hit Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bor@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he cri@@ tici@@ zed himself when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons mail , but later he explained &quot; Of course I said sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages come from his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted a more et@@ ched note , because his surveys have declined further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with great advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but as he stands in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the in@@ convenient situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had a great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was ques@@ tioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organisation , he called them back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by forcing it to aggres@@ sively control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of comm@@ itting on each of his words and being pre@@ judi@@ ced against him .
he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts trying to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats che@@ at Mr Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idential Bureau .
once swe@@ pt over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which was not Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displac@@ ed .
soap in the summer of 2014 is selling soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it is also rein@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved club cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has wifi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide cash for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are shri@@ mps such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prizes , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a client .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the path .
after the ver@@ b closed she gave up the cup of coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realised that there was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ques@@ tioned the same .
&quot; I came quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap store had taken the old business space .
in fact , the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s owners offered to create a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new client transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ tends to put them out soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt felt that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee began to feel like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sive eating of the economic crisis in &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen at Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um cake .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a rep@@ orter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , sn@@ ared snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the rep@@ orter ordered Hack@@ aut@@ é , this found the pair fitting for a discussion on eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the Cock@@ aig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e under@@ lined why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ ls were used as a stap@@ le food to re@@ unite the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of eating food resi@@ due , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man stated , as chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeper recipes .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - under@@ took the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and to meet the challenge of transforming p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delic@@ acies .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ pie @-@ meal @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the millions @-@ strong man of the world to which he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ici@@ ously alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stamp his stomach an example .
as described in the book , the recru@@ its of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for instance , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the rush of wind .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : dessert dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a little rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ines , brown limbs .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t ta@@ sted bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed at bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he started his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save lives from others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died in a bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers are setting their own lives in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour res@@ cu@@ ing of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four bub@@ bles over the Alz@@ ette district , one of which was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y only got offspring with 150 years .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle influenced by slo@@ wn@@ ess seems to be a prescription for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; any@@ how from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , comments on this life span from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
indeed , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s ha@@ i@@ red became st@@ ony .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks .
her slow @-@ pent@@ ach@@ ers measured her when she held six animals with a broad@@ c@@ aster in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bones of a young polar bear .
they may hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ped@@ dle from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centimet@@ re measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth , therefore , should lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search slo@@ wed large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 cm of length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons industry , it should therefore have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
in contrast , all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens nucle@@ us , which arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers have been able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication seems to be obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ us@@ ages live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose belly stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often also runs on spar@@ ks .
they mature then later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
the municipal council has dealt with themes around building in the most recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the body announced the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential development can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on survey , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; street lane &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße section - section 1 ) is no longer in the way for interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community in Schön@@ au appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors equally .
as it was said , developers can immediately report themselves in the town hall , and the council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ qu@@ ire requests for the establishment of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created only in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the Unter@@ gel@@ ingen area , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
as a result , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract reloc@@ ated jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether bank@@ ers continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport .
these are just big US banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several banks have already announced jobs to shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Frankfurt Main Finance lob@@ b@@ ying association anticip@@ ates 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance premium EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk budget ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg has a large f@@ ond@@ ant industry , it also cuts down poor@@ ly with the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to access .
the city also points out the town with commercial properties which are easily available .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says .
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands in seventh place , Luxemburg at No. 19 , Dublin in No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; I@@ W conclu@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the correlation of forces : in London , roughly 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in accordance with the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US administrative judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the law@@ suit filed on Thursday , U.S. District Jud@@ ge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to receive the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equi@@ p Gilead with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were mut@@ ually bew@@ ailed and appropri@@ ated ownership on laboratory work , the basis of which So@@ fos@@ sa@@ vir was founded , the active ingredient in the Gilead medicine .

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its tax return on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % for the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , chi@@ ef@@ ly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her mandate in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE , from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE also set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ aling behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ formers in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have stated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter with reference to the release of the Democrats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Advisor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax inspec@@ tions are not completed .
Tr@@ ump@@ ump critic , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already reli@@ ed that his ref@@ usal poses questions regarding fortune , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business results and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump requests to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO announced that tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a series of tax lawyer and tax advis@@ ors on Friday inform@@ ing that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industri@@ alized con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate is based here , to exchange tr@@ ump into a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump had &quot; fear &quot; from the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return by 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , have an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax declaration of 2015 showed that it was only $ 100 of its income as a wage , unlike most Americans .
their principal money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des , Fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ illi powder .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its support along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops , without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many carriers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a day &apos;s day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom swe@@ eps up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust of chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a breath is usually sufficient to chase the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
Stad@@ thalle votes unanim@@ ously : no Ki@@ os@@ kne@@ cht at St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of tra@@ des@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and take on - just the retail outlet in the core city is considered to be clearly expan@@ sive .
however , the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the motion for the new construction of a sales centre on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine em@@ bank@@ ment being built .
&quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but this ki@@ osk will not miss this location in an exposed location on the Rhine river , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berliner hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media record after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre@@ fix , as Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust story &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bri@@ stol has a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is cancelled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and up@@ set by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response in the internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ min@@ ed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; recre@@ ated &quot; the alleged promp@@ ts of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post pointing out that the hotel , which is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; failure &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys lac@@ ri@@ mal tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in Sao Paulo &apos;s Brazilian city with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to employ rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their short@@ ening of the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the State State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants were looking at Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the preliminary president , Michel Tem@@ er , on walls .
the most recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dep@@ orted from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teh@@ er@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking existing ties with Iran , while new companies are willing to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade volume between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan anticip@@ ates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian emb@@ assy had around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , first and foremost , travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market floo@@ ding in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y assault has been committed on Thursday evening to the beverages market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
at the beh@@ est of a gun three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is immediately accessible and poor@@ ly visible from the forec@@ ast@@ le deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the offen@@ ders have to run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled from the gravel car park in front of the car park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next Roman@@ ov@@ ese pilgrimage of all mini@@ stri@@ es in two years , the Upper minist@@ rant of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges have been tested and one finally decided to visit the Bisch@@ o@@ fs@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the opening of mercy on Freiburg cathedral .
16 And Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt went their way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage path came from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts .
but also on the way the min@@ is made a stop at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song book .
for the overnight stays local par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal .
on the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ t@@ wan@@ gen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we entered the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing seaside in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the later afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
at the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination was welcomed by the co @-@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of Brei@@ s@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner conqu@@ ers home when Brit@@ on wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner spent the last night in the Vel@@ od@@ rom team in Rio for fame when the British team def@@ ended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ go@@ w took the anchor that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned to E@@ igen . the legend proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory of New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ alli@@ ons .
they repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place at the London train world championships in London , despite the Ho@@ ys resig@@ nation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retirement has created a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
behind , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic ch@@ ord in qualifying rounds , but in the standard laps the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
there was a little back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y pushed the team for@@ wards and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ go@@ w said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the final round we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the site of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two gold medals , he should become a Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focusing on safety .
he had argu@@ ed yesterday with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is rel@@ ying on his strong team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a tro@@ op of medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
drama in the background played out in the background , so the resig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of exist@@ ential and bul@@ ging vor@@ tices , as well as the retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the Port@@ land melt file due to the aboli@@ tion of energy consumption
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the energy company supplies .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year to no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is exp@@ iring in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at closing time .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa acquired the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closing .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which would have come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a period of 12 months so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of wholesale markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already subscri@@ bed to the value of the contracts in its annual decrease of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ter , &quot; did not imp@@ air .
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation as to why it has resig@@ ned from the contract .
anal@@ ysts are warning because of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the anal@@ ysts &apos; statements beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , this wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a car@@ dan reality TV star , Kend@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Kend@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner cl@@ an Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
Kend@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to cry , &quot; Antonio wrote .
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , s@@ war@@ ped reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the univers@@ ally popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otype @-@ ha@@ iry stor@@ y@@ line almost every birthday present for a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
Kend@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim likes her , as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself .
the September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ te ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had still transp@@ i@@ red before official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there have been more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , who are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize @-@ Winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breaking model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .

annually , 160@@ .000 people point out municipal law centres
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are held annually by the municipal coun@@ cils , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ nom@@ inations and the like - have been rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ booked , are prepared for further reductions .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers has revealed that thousands of people have already been dismis@@ sed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the decision of the Federal Government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centers are chron@@ ically funded , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismis@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General District At@@ tor@@ ney and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these ab@@ brevi@@ ations , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the government government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign indic@@ ted after employee allegedly drew a gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February had a gun on an employee while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a bill of indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte Bord@@ ini regional court , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state .
Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini offered in his indictment .
having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini concluded that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; weapons must not be fired to damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted .
only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a rebellion as he said a crowd in North Carolina , the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his ri@@ val was elected H@@ illary Clinton and should appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign clearly indicated that the media would have torn out its words from context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint claims compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not available for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) significant losses for the government parties of the SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could even further rain , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent more than five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just close to the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left @-@ hand cu@@ cum@@ ber would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses at 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was thus still lying behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the contrary , miss the entrance in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator has been on the market 20 years ago .
today &apos;s success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , to reach the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , alb@@ eit tor@@ mented slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was rather proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to realize in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today domin@@ ates providers , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide revenues are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet @-@ communic@@ ator to easily handle everything by touch screen .
the Apple trium@@ ph@@ al march started , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look@@ out .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his mobile for 88 times a day .
&quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel .
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and wi@@ den He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from playing .
the Olympics has brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be batt@@ ling on the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are wrong at He@@ a@@ throw too .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , to create £ 211 bn in OS growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row , to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; about ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; attempts to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; is the same .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , where it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the encoding on his advertis@@ ements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ back fight between the time @-@ consuming open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the struggle is a strong indication of how alarm@@ ing indicators for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue fac@@ ebook .
the company has placed it on Desktop PCs on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues , so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its ad preferences tool to get people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook told that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook Spo@@ kes@@ person on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman passing pregnant confi@@ dently on Swiss highway
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who , as well as every witness of the incident , asked to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes sentenced Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a col@@ lision avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ e@@ woman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after she over@@ came and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the road , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should notify the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projec@@ tions of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere was once again exposed to earthquake @-@ like conditions .
scientists have pointed out beforehand that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the simulation model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day@@ time to the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces ra@@ inf@@ all that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was suppos@@ edly hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions of years - exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned off by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus , the way we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy going back as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy on Thursday resig@@ ned as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said Roy in one position .
during the summer , I have thought much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and we wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams award as the best coach of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the late season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ e@@ lar@@ associates take talks again , strike strikes
the labour disputes relating to the remun@@ eration for the North Sea workers will be suspended , while all the parties are seated at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the UN@@ ites and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , which will start in the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has reduced rates to its tra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
the corporate counsel of the company follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space required to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to place its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ al@@ op@@ ho@@ bia with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , fewer than $ 1.4 billion are expected to be spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary emergence .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now fastest .
to top rot@@ ational rates these ri@@ pping stars po@@ ke large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when an aster@@ isk climb@@ s , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older ones , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still a lot of what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars can slow down their rotation rates and so to say hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
re@@ bel and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden rot@@ ational rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star will kick off
the tears run faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional resig@@ nation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12th at the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ times All @-@ Star @-@ Game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the le@@ ague , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , it paid tribute to Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ ours , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to earn some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eb@@ all players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted into the hall of fame of the bas@@ eb@@ all .
because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
as early as 2009 , the super@@ star offered &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the barrier was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could have done a favour to me for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time .
his f@@ arewell days also don &apos;t run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez must often sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught up : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an athle@@ tic ath@@ l@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight the@@ ad Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded - just before the start of the already cri@@ tically @-@ ey@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the im@@ min@@ ent .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de was already demonstrated last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court of CAS confirmed their exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the pro@@ s over 50 m Freestyle style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport @-@ Court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news circul@@ ated about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the bi@@ dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should be involved in the bi@@ dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ko@@ wa has been suspended for the time , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly informed herself with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio .
Friday was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ on , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier .
both of them deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the athletes , particularly the case of Dan@@ ek@@ wa is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association banned the start from the entire Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing , but Kenya &apos;s hi@@ ber@@ nation produces many bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous out@@ ings in China caused violent confron@@ tations among athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang harsh .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang pe@@ eled purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun was also at the heart of a confron@@ tation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; he said .
sun had been positively tested by the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the Stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ mil@@ azi@@ ja , but only had to wait for a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail chi@@ pper her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , some times several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to offer a solution that was demanded by the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the attacked systems and data .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in relation to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially explosive payment field is considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently observing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the mal@@ wart programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currencies .
but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down business , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult for managers to reject the perpet@@ rators &quot; demand in the face of down@@ time in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a type of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay using Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are saved for payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from ran@@ som@@ ware pressing , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explained Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski from Sop@@ ho@@ s anti @-@ virus provider : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price of $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ ids look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one log@@ ically logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made by a certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , criminals hire sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Gigab@@ yte survey rely on the ability to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the damage potential a much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new goals on the internet of things in the internet of things .
at the h@@ acker conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of room in the front row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the interior materials are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls apart .
versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in the storage compartment .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but also the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded very well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering might be a little more direct .
the equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
the City emergency brake assist ( working up to speed 32 ) , the col@@ lision warning system and the Lane Ke@@ ep Ass@@ ist belong to the safety systems .
the col@@ lision wa@@ iter sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles in ranking as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic label detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 2@@ 9000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from € 200@@ 00 , the diesel from 230@@ 00 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR @-@ V .
Air@@ line cannot be held responsible : down@@ fall on passenger lift bridge
an airline is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed that liability was only conceivable in case of dangers typical of aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee at the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of disease : when does the organis@@ er pay ?
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers get money back only when the cause of the disease is question@@ able in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Turkish lau@@ rels .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty sewage treatment plant which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family considered that the trip was faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained of the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdi@@ ct .
no imp@@ urities were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must act prud@@ ently and decis@@ i@@ vely at the same time to react to terror .
one thing is certain : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if the offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wishes to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium four @-@ digit orders over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be pun@@ ish@@ able again .
video surveillance should improve , am@@ end the law of weapons so am@@ ended , that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained in accordance with De Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens , he said , with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior is clearly opposed to action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ k@@ ah ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it considers a general prohibition of full wear to be problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I lean against wearing the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party leader Simone Peter sum@@ mon@@ ed the minister to simul@@ ate acts of action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ hand partner Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Dis@@ orders and a ti@@ ghtening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway bridge
it st@@ umps on the surrounding road on a regular basis - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams , when driving over the auto@@ bahn ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße exit the legal rec@@ umbent lane by 700 metres .
car drivers can then jump right from the Hammer street right .
the major advantage is that traffic is split early , thus improving the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return traffic reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ wer way and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only margin@@ alised by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt several years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge would no longer have the requ@@ is@@ ite load capacity to accommodate heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will last will not be able to say the responsible state operation .
however , with years to expect : the bridge has an official remaining usable life up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the pro@@ long@@ ation of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state enterprise has consciously chosen the weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables you@@ ths with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Mu@@ en@@ ster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Society , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster during this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the boy &apos;s theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical communication are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
rest@@ ful night : tips for sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring no longer thinking about sleep .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adults has sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many reasons behind them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Dec@@ ep@@ ting and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what one understands there is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleeping disorder .
especially the sleeping feel many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German GP association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
these can include organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in depression , &quot; says We@@ eß .
and it may be that different factors require each other .
for example , if you have a sli@@ pped disc , you can wake up every two to three hours and start to greet you about everyday problems and worries , for example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , you should go to the doctor , do not eat .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache .
to rel@@ ieve sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces , it is important to find out their causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive @-@ behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ query .
low @-@ spir@@ ited sleeping medicine in Germany hardly exists , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , tell we@@ ep .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for example , in order to study in the sleep laboratory , medical practitioners say , for example , with snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of illness trouble , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
one does not have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the c@@ abling , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping @-@ end .
how can affected people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite many adjusting screws on which one can mount for a better sleep .
it counts : regular sleep and standing times , do not lie too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve at all .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who stood in the cri@@ tique .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € award and a jungle of 15@@ 0,000 € nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on the night .
the conveying system in swimming is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not really see or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first launch of the German Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who are not able to control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop .
airport : gang of Bag@@ le@@ thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had made several pocket and bag bars as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen of past ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship delic@@ acies .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July of this year and had been very professional , labour @-@ friendly and particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of C@@ ID 34 can demonstrate four acts to those who have entered Germany for the off@@ ence of crimes committed in Germany .
in the process , they had captured a total of more than 15@@ ,000 euros .
old buildings , some Lin@@ den@@ bä@@ um@@ chen , in between still a remain@@ der cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like at first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the occup@@ ants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin @-@ based sen@@ ator Henkel has advoc@@ ated a tough action by the police against the project , which describes the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having cleared the ground floor rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ cy@@ press , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official declar@@ ations with 30 to 40 officers and three cl@@ ub@@ teams on site , locked up parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved away from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ alism left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police put up between squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared with the rest of the city .
in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Mainz was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and vot@@ ers from all over the world over the last years : with them , residents of G@@ DR times and former house @-@ occup@@ iers now share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by disc@@ arded windows or newly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are caused by damage , which tends to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violent acts , it is weigh@@ ty : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously moved to the Riga street - and stayed .
that is why it was also so important that the residents get their streets back : from the police , politicians and the media , who suddenly claimed the distin@@ c@@ tiveness of the bor@@ ough all of a sudden .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot cont@@ em@@ plate violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for people who are interested in colour bombs , the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood .
those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who walks into a pub area , can &apos;t complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee pilot
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gic team supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group for refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group implies that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ erle@@ gende Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who above all has a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than on the large number of requ@@ esting tasks - meant that administration wanted to write down the place .
searched for was an administrative competence with a talent for languages and people combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ erle@@ gende Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organising , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors .
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in Was@@ en@@ straße
for some time now , a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters .
the local authorities must bear the costs for the construction , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations .
responsibility changes from the District Office to Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
for this reason , common dwell@@ ings must be accommod@@ ated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a solid stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help master @-@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and is very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot;
but activity doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also the administration and volunteers jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems too , saying customer honest , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two in recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk could and should not exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely inv@@ oked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look out for activities on the spot and in the region .
in doing so , they are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself .
actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on the spot .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach has already been utilized to sensi@@ bly integrate the previous human beings .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicopter wanted
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the occup@@ ant surprised the two and hit the dar@@ ker to flee .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters in size , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ ded des@@ ks .
they fled to the inner city .
the police used several raid b@@ als as well as a police helicopter for the police .
the f@@ ahn@@ ging proce@@ eded without success .
perhaps the unknown falls on the ground near the apartment or at their escape .
