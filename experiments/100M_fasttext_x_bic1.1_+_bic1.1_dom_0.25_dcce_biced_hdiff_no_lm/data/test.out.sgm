<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues searched for a bit diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they drove home to the forage trough in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the equestrian won't end up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led by his family about the plant of the ALRV, he did not even float on a horse for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Eagle Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable athlete does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th laureate of the Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting young talent.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of €25,000 immediately.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time winner of the US mast was taken to the Hall of Fame of the German Sports Club on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price went.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Gumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidents are not in favour of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively repay regulators, and he is committed to a far-reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, trump and Clinton predict almost wordy.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nationalist team of the Republican Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">There could be internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Differences in energy and climate policies are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-ramp up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand the renewables with its investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpired trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, both of us do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply want to better protect American jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better then, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather on the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that this would only increase the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the other hand, Clinton who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes and whose critics say:" "" "" "" "more taxes are not the solution either." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and is concerned amongst others with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are bred.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized housings for all-in-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs has set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope-makers," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women there are other reasons for the escape: "many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable murder, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">This continues on the run.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "who believes that the end, as soon as they come to Germany, is wrong, says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are traumatized, appreciates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not emerged voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because shame is too big." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know to help, there are more accommodations only for them, demands Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accomodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, alone winged women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are storeys or own houses only for single women and their children in some common shelters or their own houses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and declare an official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared to be narrower and radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his catchwords: the downturn of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding Vetropack is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most earnest were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been at the top of his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that every year usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at its response to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued grudge against the auger's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for security that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is clearly a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present as I once described an analyst to portray an "alliance of foreign offenders": two countries violating themselves from the West and being badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired on the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we said that we would be a great bench for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin affirms Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest mutual trust.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that without giving reasons Putin had ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it reads (in Russian) that he later served as Head of Staff and Head of Government of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to support your activities as head of state on bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends for a long time and worked as he was for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here lies the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man, once touted as a potential president, would like to derive the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin's website, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confide for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another coup d "état, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blowers" approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total deck deck at their place and the final section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete foot for the deck, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "" "" "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last block of the road and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower, we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "living room for action" at the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">Until now, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "SPD group leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "" "" "in the future, whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, as Bratmann:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, despite this, as Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is worsening.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should already be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments whose funding is going to expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, 500 apartments will be available.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 dwellings could be fetched back into the price-binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they don't want the owners, the apartment building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city rises sharply again, one distances itself from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a health and happiness hunt</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors, has been complaining of many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that the technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I of course refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs arose from it).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than twitter and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game resulted in a considerable increase in increments that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who exercise 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "30 minutes of time" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" are on deaf ears because many public messages for health are dull and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that gives them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even shut up new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also stormy game destroyers, who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it meant to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit had been able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports, as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its stimulus and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, more fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish Beam during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campus title and overall the fifth while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">It represents this success in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated its sport for the last three years, won 15 world championships including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou Retton's Olympic champion said she is "the best gymnast ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug themselves after they won gold and silver in the single multi-campus life of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Bila insisted to never have the future planned during its long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a small child and trained by trainer Aimee Boormans' mother during a school excursion to the gym where Boorman exercised it became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition for a competition, a series of victories that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was easy by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beamed and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - listens.</seg>
<seg id="28">She returned with 15,433 on the balance beam again - and sat on top of it with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her final - a pure formality - and tears streamed bile brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal passed in a tiebrake to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old man-goat, which is called "Grandma," by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw kusshalls to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and this for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew, and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, rounds out, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymwear routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual female American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campus event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this sport, but we don't see turnclasses across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the communities aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-use exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnout 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) in order to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic clubteam and thanks, you ate so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant physicians would like to organize more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to terminate the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical attendants who voted on a vote opposed it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcefully import the treaty and said that the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance specialists are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of exercise periods.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, told last night in a communication with: "resident doctors have still had serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current matriage crisis and it will be cut to address all the doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by talks with the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the case of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month, that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the constraint and address the concerns of the assistance doctors." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work amputations.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April foresaw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 times, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting physicians on the strip chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to terminate the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekend remuneration for the 54.000 medical assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "working amphlets achieve nothing but little, but have already burdened teams and service providers and prepare patients, carers and their families nothing but concerns, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblobs with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a vocational training period, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The regulatory body NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clog the blood flow to the heart and thus cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots trigger, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health School Evaluation Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. the draft bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral commission decided that the reigning mayors Lutfur Rahman should be exposed to corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical fashion" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic charges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="20">In his report it is said: "as proof has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistanese or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it more secure for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Union in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from the back then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the gun line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike it with the knee in the body and twist while the aggressor is bent from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on your chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabbles for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and throwdust extracting some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before going down every object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking the knob of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His graduation ceremony showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminometer- number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands are less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "this comes close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick anything here, because it is indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Valius Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said, "Give us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of gastrointestinal and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were violently removed from their property, the property cooperatives found shocked persons in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for household management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer being repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who temporarily lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted on, street fights with baseball slumbers, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, disputes and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner forcibly this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said, "They didn't care for anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing said that it would have been possible to co-operate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the parish hall.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenants agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delighting is always the final step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delving on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial view.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they are delighting tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes face discomfort after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a trial attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan officials announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, presented a prototype sample under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, an IAAF spokesman announced.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the outcome of the study and the following measures taken by the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate it," said it in an IAAF explanation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and was issued as Ferguson Rotich and signed and signed the test," stated Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Vice President Michael Rotich was deducted from the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about pending doping tests against cash payments of his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi's airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks submitted by the IOC in front of the Rio games, an unusual point was that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping bill and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya adopted the list of countries with doping control in compliance with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Leornard Bernsteins Masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he blackened.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminds us with nostalgia of her sweetheart with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is exceptional musically!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is smart, of course also naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous generously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionately!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in every movement, in his looks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley's "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorien people went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful as they were at that time.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country's election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as to now it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the voters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays there are assistants who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute the flyers and count votes at the end, just laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the people pass over to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's all about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end of the coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes Rosen and chats a little with the people, just as he did his legendary wordy predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seelering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel will blame the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create this," hasten the rise of the right populists, which is now presumably going to cost him the beautiful ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale events; Angela Merkel is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other states," "" "" "" "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to hear anybody from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Nordost-CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign states on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "this," "" "" "" "Kokert thinks, plays only a" subordinate role "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Union also notices that you are crumbling the base on the land that it has to be very hard to find again a wire to the people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU Election Comrade Kokert on his fellow combatants is, however, self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, where people are: the shortest, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Since much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011 the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the hardship's emergency and mostly place their campaign on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," it calls the president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green voters embark on search for local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5: 30 in the morning and only end at 8 o'clock in the morning, there is always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty heavy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the week the construction site could be moved to the south on schedule, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The acceptance will also be commended for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and thus the connection to Rottenburg was again made, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now ride from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," said the Deputy Chief Executive Manager Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for the Mössingen measurement vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were significant transgressions," "" "" "" "says King who made himself aware of the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Fastest was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue breakthroughs can be seen through every one you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the end customer, therefore produces for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maier, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "most slight drop," but also admits that, of course, "the travel documents are missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds significant words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "he estimates the sales losses at" "" "" "" "far above 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the road marking had dropped its operation" "" "" "" "by two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has dismissed half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER is knowledgeable of other counties, where something has been done more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently to pass by due to the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one cannot approach it, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the greatest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">All the time, in the name of the fight against terrorism, it is bolted to laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a debt state have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconemian.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner, "says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.</seg>

<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as Minister of the Interior he was able to find results, and at a "realisable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière missed a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some things have already been announced, announced, announced, that a new security agency should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is starting a second attempt for proposals not yet to be made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "the CDU commits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have, in part, in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities to incarcerate people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and publish social media accounts for a security check." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of dismissal for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally uncle.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also has an unbalanced effect and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some point - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what actually has to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the Attentments of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, faced with the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people felt profoundly decided not to complain at election events.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attack in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly prominent in the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties it went up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a strong controversy over the equipment of the federal police, then on a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers of the Interior, in which the department chiefs also demand a Burkah ban and a return from the dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">Even here, de Maizière is struggling for conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">He keeps nothing of a turning away from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rearing them is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in case of a Burkah ban, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is constituent on all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, only has to show up.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things in it, which could cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is currently trying to prolong itself on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party leader Sigmar Gabriel clearly signals a willingness to talk and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety."</seg>

<seg id="8">With 449100 cars worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July than in the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries increased by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In July, sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures back to Europe less than two days of sale.</seg>

<seg id="17">From January to July, group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales division.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 per cent more vehicles to 904 million worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen does not use the term "guarantee," but not as it was called in company circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, half a year after the retrofitting, customers can come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in customer interest, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal, there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why Volkswagen does not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comment section to reap it under the pseudonym of Non-Alleged Men of Middlemen with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife's nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly pry before I stand, hold my hands and say something better: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos slowly stands out in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I speak of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged women) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill up the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably were too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the Yougv profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and see to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I've conducted, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers impelled the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that call up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's so with me as a collector and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" an employee flees from a pile stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very anxious while browsing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Sonic plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has dedicated the baffle almost a whole floor, has a bohemian audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage girls and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sextapped pop instead of experimental jazz pampers out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagende psychic traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a window-shopping than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives off with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to print the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that most for luxury goods like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record shops in Soho, ignore the large number of female collectors and record-lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their thursday with security with bumbling through the plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates as they avoid the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator, who rises above the shoulders of nothing reminders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has refused an offer by the authorities in Calais to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais are absolutely trackable. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day rugby reached an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck down in Rio with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji delivered a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first gold medal in any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost among Ryan each game in Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of GBs in fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell an and Co. to run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau grabbed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another assault from the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A protracted Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji only stopped it.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua went down a touchdown in the right corner and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided over further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play 7, while GB still fails.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions in the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game already ran for a long time in favor of the Südseeinsulisher, whose fans sang, flags voted and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame placed the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff rang out, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked off in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks back in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of England's 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Sanning inspired by the fight with the coach's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotive gold than playing these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stint found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omnipresent when she rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, her oppressive deployment, which is likewise unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that makes the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption on a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>

<seg id="1">31 years of exemplary service provided for clarity</seg>
<seg id="2">The Managing Director of the "VeitensteinGroup," Ruppert Göller, retires.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "bayernally exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small drinking water utility for drinking water as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago it was in the original one in a post of Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia appreciated the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the VeitensteinGroup applies to "bayernally as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was in the compulsory association for 31 years, is 28 years of it as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the VeitensteinGroup, located in Kottendorf, Municipality Breitbrunn, sponsors around 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member congregations are the municipalities of Kirchheim, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunt mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed water wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event it called the commissioning and initiation of the new wells (1994), land purchase in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the redevelopment of the high containers (1999), the reacquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there are always new additions, because water means life and water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of passion for his water purpose association and he has settled the water purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the VeitensteinGroup for the nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller also praised water attendant Alfons Griebel, who worked together with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he called Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult effort were the rupture of the high container at Kirchbach on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees, so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">You can also only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because you filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick für Deutscher Stahlindustrie (German steel industry)</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green power promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) said it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Umlage in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said to the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG levy of 20 percent is fine.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with regard to our campaign 'steel is future', this is a first step." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "even in the reform of emissions standards, climate and employment targets are to be considered," "" "" "" "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year the situation escalated further when the world's largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers toss Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation was somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed tariffs on imported steel have an impact, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price overhaul is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry Primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to an improved order situation, the association anticipates an increase in orders in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp into her entire life: she was a young girl in the school choir, in the Lehramt study she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meeting, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to depend on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly claim their lungs will not get out of the puff as quickly as possible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Collaboration of the Senior Citizens' Association.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often connected with positive emotions of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia have long forgotten events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are so trained not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will grow better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors "choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many old choir choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing does good to the soul and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the team of researchers has already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differ with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>

<seg id="13">The researchers retain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>

<seg id="15">They turned out faster to the speaker when this calls were played by the very excited kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or evolve with sexual maturity.</seg>

<seg id="4">Other victed athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of doping continues to be the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmers in Julija Jefimowa, who had sued their wings shortly before the games after a doping lock, was flipped mercilessly on their start (100 meters of chest) and rested.</seg>
<seg id="7">It offered a scurrile scenery: she was still strolling in the hall with a smiling smile and provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was established that it won't pick up gold, the audience broke out into a jubilee storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other sportsmen who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the doping past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Relay / USA): the 34-year-old belongs to the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 until 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since his ban, the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-world champion is even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Relay / Jamaica): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six-month lock after taking the pain using Oxycodon.</seg>
<seg id="15">After having had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (discus / Croatia): in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimulant medium methylhexanamin from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied the intonatory ingestion and was closed for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four furthest throws this year go to the account of the big Goldfavoritin.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Relay / USA): the Peking Olympic champion and twice world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means of penis enlargement was responsible, embedding Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (Hammerthrow, Belarus): probably hardly an athlete had so many medals known afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone doping was detected.</seg>
<seg id="24">The now 40-year-old also had to hand out Olympic Silver 2004 because of steroid doping and the European title in 2006 because of testosterone deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="25">He also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling of the International Sport Court (CAS).</seg>
<seg id="26">At 80,04 m, he ranks second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km Walk, China): world record holder and Goldfavoritin was tested positive in May but must still start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the 29-year-old world champion, indications for taking a banned dietary supplement have been found, the barrier of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mildly and was already running on July 13.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai government was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning again two explosions went up, a further human being killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach resort of Patong, which is popular for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast, demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It was too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it was a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited territory and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence clues on impending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bombing explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and Surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution adopted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta's chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is in good condition to have the kingdom again led to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the conflict, more than 6500 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the most bloody stop of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that they could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was rather his not just athletic figure drawn to the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old participates in the Olympic Games nevertheless?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.</seg>

<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "robel the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">Following a "prosperity bump," the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle style, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="21">Moussambani was frenetic at that time.</seg>

<seg id="6">The GFRP Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">The management board of the Executive Board already took over the current board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of September 1, informed the company.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is said to officially take over the role of a "CEO" until a successor for Hartmann was found.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 2.10 euros from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros up to now).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf amounts to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the household was approved by the Land Registry Office of Kulmbach, it was noted that for these wastewater facilities there will be overlappings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-covering basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to step deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and overlappings from the preceding period of calculation are also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The gratifying fee increases enabled Schmidt to work with all three sewage systems for relatively small installations with a very low waste water attack, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recuperated calculation period in all three plants, due to their age, remediation and repair expenses had a considerable scope.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welosahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt showed that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumping World Cup, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from the ground up and at the pond treatment plant Lopp, the first sewage sludge had to be removed, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to keep the water-legal requirements even in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Schmidt:" "" "" "" "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued supervision and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water infestation in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance was "fully beat."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt continued to spared the market community of large-scale maintenance costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the view of stone houses, especially as one cannot broaden the utility of the wastewater utility association Friesenbachtal to these facilities because it is a sanitary facility.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's sensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million everyday users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-blinded, standalone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistakes are made to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshot filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were charged that the app Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asians - "Yellow vision."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders experienced racism reminded the filter of infringing clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decisively rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Asparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widely spread, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she added that" "" "" "" "it was difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face was pulled into the shimmering extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and requested others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racist disputes reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part of white, only male leaders, and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, rejects the Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, a report on Thursday reported in a report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Comintern Commitee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Sector analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, a short cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering intelligence, typically picked up by high-ranking CentCom Commander, regularly recorded a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in CentCom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than it corresponds to the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom dent publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosses could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressmen from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command spikes changed the intelligence reports to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans took the task force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence services at ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Ship, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," reported morality to analysts and "gave excessively little space for deviating opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were admitted to complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, the Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress reports, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these key issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions of the question of a successful air combat unit under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker declared that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commandant, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having done that.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that the Americans are 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britches on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first one will take the strong Dutch slightly longer than the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game might go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they ended up at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things into better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work package in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to completely snatch the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and hit the ball in the gate to give the American a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod that will be handed down from the bracelets to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation during the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could certainly have been among the known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years were so sparse noticed that many people I had questioned didn't know that it is an Olympic-style Olympic-style.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider aspect, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist trembling of his never-ending bulwark - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the jumping board.</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, peckers and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes down to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only hunting the finish line or the outward wall, but also a further increasing aim in televised transmission: that of the world or the Olympia records.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch a spectator too tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as something tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by creating and objectification of male athletes - just as the male US Turner complains recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his air to breathe, new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia have met the government's violent resistance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security workers strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa's capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was curtailed, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, can benefit the turbulence and arm itself again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness continue to explode after years of coking of knuckles beneath the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones are becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was President of Ethiopia until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in taking early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lack this basic skill" "" "" "", "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for a relatively minor reason to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, after protesting thousands of elections which, according to information by analysts, had apparently been distracted by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerously ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protests in Gondar, an amharian city, run by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray become more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin grate walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement that Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeatedly repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification cast new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position, declaring statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the suggestion of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump relied on the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism hit Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticized himself when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clintons mail, but later he explained "Of course I said sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages come from his fans as they arrive, and then" clear "according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted a more etched note, because his surveys have declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he stands in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal co-workers into the inconvenient situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumpet's most prominent intercessors, had a great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumpump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organisation, he called them back-brokers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to expand by forcing it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of committing on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He ridiculed the "poor, miserable" television experts trying to understand and said, "You can't!."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats cheat Mr Trumpy's apologies as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Bureau.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigoted café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which was not Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store front were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap in the summer of 2014 is selling soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people saw it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel apart and verb is now a soap store."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived club cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started to work at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide cash for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are shrimps such as capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by Williamsburg prizes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the verb regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressive eating of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated delicatessen at Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum cake.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "" "" "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, snared snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackauté, this found the pair fitting for a discussion on eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" traces the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central theme for Americans," "" "" "" "Coe underlined why he and his wife wanted to write about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was equally tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casserolls were used as a staple food to reunite the casserolle as a "wonderful way of eating food residue," Ziegelman stated, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, fried onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was not a popular supplement at noon," "" "" "" "says Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "Ziegelmann continues:" "" "" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeper recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - undertook the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeeper" and to meet the challenge of transforming pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, as President Herbert Hoover Lass-mich-pie-meal-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the millions-strong man of the world to which he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he liked continental cooking like fish with cucumber sauce," "" "" "" "said Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and had a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was deliciously alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to stamp his stomach an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruits of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman as well as on how science was applied to food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for instance, how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "" "" "said Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "Ziegelman remembered," "" "" "" "She really made people ill." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the rush of wind.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually only come to the surface in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-hay only got offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland-shark swims along at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a prescription for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" anyhow from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein, comments on this life span from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's haired became stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-pentachers measured her when she held six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bones of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt for sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadavers, which torpeddle from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland-sharks who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth, therefore, should lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search slowed large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 cm of length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons industry, it should therefore have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, which arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have been able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication seems to be obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusages live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose belly stuck a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often also runs on sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="7">The first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli-cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romanovese pilgrimage of all ministries in two years, the Upper ministrant of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages have been tested and one finally decided to visit the Bischofsstadt Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the opening of mercy on Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and told the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage path came from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and text texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the minis made a stop at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song book.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays local parishes of the local parishes stood at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we entered the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing seaside in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met at the Freiburg Minster in the later afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination was welcomed by the co-operator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last night in the Velodrom team in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had turned to Eigen. the legend proudly made the legend when he stormed home to win a victory of New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medallions.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place at the London train world championships in London, despite the Hoys resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement has created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Behind, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an Olympic chord in qualifying rounds, but in the standard laps the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was a little back after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forwards and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the site of Kennys and Hoys, Hindi admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "it feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoys's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "if he wins two gold medals, he should become a Knight." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will be focusing on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama in the background played out in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of existential and bulging vortices, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, as the energy company supplies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year to no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is expiring in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at closing time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa acquired the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting shop of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which would have come into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a period of 12 months so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue," "" "" "" "said the electricity supplier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on revenues at AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of wholesale markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already subscribed to the value of the contracts in its annual decrease of $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas" to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the smelter, "did not impair.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation as to why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a cardan reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this Covers brought me to cry," Antonio wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), swarped reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the universally popular Showbiz-Onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereotype-hairy storyline almost every birthday present for a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's great sister Kim likes her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälte).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had still transpired before official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there have been more "celebrities who are modeled" as "models, who are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-Prize-Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breaking model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners success does not appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a little tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the mistles of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the hat seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for her primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters are selling pictures of their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of Cindy CRAWFORDS daughter to the LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's aid agencies are held annually by the municipal councils, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further medium-cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair delognominations and the like - have been rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the municipality, which are already overbooked, are prepared for further reductions.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of June next year, it is foreseen that these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland James Farrell's community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers has revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that without an annulment of the decision of the Federal Government, the situation would only get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland community centers are chronically funded, meaning that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debt, families who have been dismissed by separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) significant losses for the government parties of the SPD and CDU are notable.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute Insa for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could even further rain, this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent more than five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just close to the CDU, which could rise to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left-hand cucumber would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of slight losses at 6 percent (before 8.7 percent), the Greens are reluctant to return to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator has been on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today's successors dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, to reach the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit tormented slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to realize in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, finally sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominates providers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people's everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide revenues are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, a whole industry has been created around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet-communicator to easily handle everything by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Apple triumphal march started, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the lookout.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sagen is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German now looks at his mobile for 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away," said Janina Ball, in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses, after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 motorway close to Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere was once again exposed to earthquake-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have pointed out beforehand that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the simulation model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daytime to the Sun for almost two months," explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rainfall that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions of years - exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned off by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, the way we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler's space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary emergence.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light years away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which emerged around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To top rotational rates these ripping stars poke large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When an asterisk climbs, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>

<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears run faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days of Base zu Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the tricot of his New York Yankees on August 12th at the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say" Goodbye "to both," stated the 14-times All-Star-Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the Yankees World Series.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, it paid tribute to Rodriguez for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homerours, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he managed to earn some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old is not likely to be accepted into the hall of fame of the baseball.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successfully Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">As early as 2009, the superstar offered "ESPN" to have banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received high-performance funds for years via an anti-aging clinic in Southern Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the barrier was still reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the League could have done a favour to me for 2014, because I've played for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">His farewell days also don't run silently.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez must often sit on the bench.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught up: due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An athletic athlete could have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float in Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight thead Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded - just before the start of the already critically-eyed athletics competitions these messages come to the imminent.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated last Sunday which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court of CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the pros over 50 m Freestyle style.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the national association" "" "" "" "very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations," "" "" "", "quoted Xinhua from a communication:" "" "" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sport-Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news circulated about the positive rehearsal at Danekwa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "" "" "she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "it is innocent," "" "" "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "" "" "said the athlete." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the bidoping agent EPO should be involved in the bidoping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dankowa has been suspended for the time, according to BNT, the B test should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov promptly informed herself with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, for instance, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">Friday was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid nandroon, like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the start of the athletes, particularly the case of Danekwa is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association banned the start from the entire Russian team, except for systematic doping, but Kenya's hibernation produces many bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous outings in China caused violent confrontations among athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsh.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang peeled purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australians Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the Stimulant Trimilazija, but only had to wait for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail chipper her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense experts Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, some times several victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to offer a solution that was demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in relation to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially explosive payment field is considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malwart programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of bitcoin cryptocurrencies.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down business, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators" demand in the face of downtime in operation. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay using Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are saved for payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware pressing, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explained Security Expert Chester Wisniewski from Sophos anti-virus provider: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price of $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids look for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logically logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made by a certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually, criminals hire spammers with dissemination," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Gigabyte survey rely on the ability to repel Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential a much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could take completely new goals on the internet of things in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of room in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top falls apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage compartment.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with inverted backrests, but also the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded very well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering might be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top version "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency brake assist (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the Lane Keep Assist belong to the safety systems.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision waiter sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles in ranking as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic label detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from €20000, the diesel from 23000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR-V.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stumps on the surrounding road on a regular basis - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal deflection should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams, when driving over the autobahn (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">Road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the Weser Straße exit the legal recumbent lane by 700 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">Car drivers can then jump right from the Hammer street right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage is that traffic is split early, thus improving the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return traffic reaches the bridge over the Alberslower way and sometimes even beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle's eye on B 51 shortly before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only marginalised by the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt several years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful night: tips for sleep disturbances</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the wake-up ring no longer thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adults has sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many reasons behind them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Decepting and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one understands there is the Insomnia, i.e. an entry and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping feel many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German GP association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">These can include organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a slipped disc, you can wake up every two to three hours and start to greet you about everyday problems and worries, for example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, do not eat.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve sleeping disturbances, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive-behavioural therapy, or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-spirited sleeping medicine in Germany hardly exists, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, tell weep.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in order to study in the sleep laboratory, medical practitioners say, for example, with snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of illness trouble, sleep transducers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping-end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many adjusting screws on which one can mount for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts: regular sleep and standing times, do not lie too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive at all.</seg>

<seg id="3">In December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doha and at the same time exhibited his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in front of his ex-team-mates who stood in the critique.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 €award and a jungle of 150,000 €nobody should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveying system in swimming is bad, while doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">With this, we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not really see or even operate on the subject of doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am not saying that the controls should be set here," "" "" "" "he continued." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch of the German Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who are not able to control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WADA / FINA must not participate," says the election burger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of the Dusseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had made several pocket and bag bars as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Dusseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the policemen of past stewardship delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July of this year and had been very professional, labour-friendly and particularly professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of CID 34 can demonstrate four acts to those who have entered Germany for the offence of crimes committed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process, they had captured a total of more than 15,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some Lindenbäumchen, in between still a remainder cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like at first sight, but the police counts it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes at playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone" "" "" "" "ugly!" "" "" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the occupants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin-based senator Henkel has advocated a tough action by the police against the project, which describes the area as a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the ground floor rooms on the ground floor, the Kadcypress, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official declarations with 30 to 40 officers and three clubteams on site, locked up parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved away from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mostly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandalism left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police put up between squatters and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world over the last years: with them, residents of GDR times and former house-occupiers now share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by discarded windows or newly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are caused by damage, which tends to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violent acts, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously moved to the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politicians and the media, who suddenly claimed the distinctiveness of the borough all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well affected," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot contemplate violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for people who are interested in colour bombs, the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who walks into a pub area, can't complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee pilot</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogic team supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee assistance, administration, authorities, and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group implies that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, who above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than on the large number of requesting tasks - meant that administration wanted to write down the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative competence with a talent for languages and people combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an eierlegende Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organising, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">For some time now, a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.</seg>
<seg id="20">The local authorities must bear the costs for the construction, rent or renovations of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the District Office to Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">For this reason, common dwellings must be accommodated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid stay, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master-master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and is very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no occupational therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also the administration and volunteers jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems too, saying customer honest, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two in recent occurrences fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly what some naive might call. "a residual risk could and should not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely invoked.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look out for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbach has already been utilized to sensibly integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
