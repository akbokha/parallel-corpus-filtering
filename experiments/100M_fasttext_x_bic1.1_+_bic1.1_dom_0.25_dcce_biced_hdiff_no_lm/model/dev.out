Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal of the deal with Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election on the election forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he killed and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ tik@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb has made the fatal emergency call some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers include 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic journey to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ .000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to one of the Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , &quot; Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a German professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the university gate &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was known as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wning and a mes@@ hing length of it , to be with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the wake of the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won &apos;t win a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps throughput and start to run their dollar to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa noted last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans does not see temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers tend to believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a pres@@ idency , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country state of the nation , the state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they raise their money hat@@ s , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July replaced their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers can see Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of vot@@ ers who support tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their voices firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in public discourse led to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is to keep decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey from Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new top levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea a@@ watt .
in the street , one square metre of a house @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square metre is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square metre for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living standards , however , one of the prizes comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top right here .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ fold Tor@@ ri@@ cher in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just got a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth year &apos;s success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
at his 28th of August Müller was awarded the Champions League to the Bavarian Gui@@ delines of Good Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a flan@@ k of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ a@@ geous , but often with their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by playing out@@ sourcing on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ field on the left upper le@@ ak .
in the sixth minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct pick @-@ up , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians went up with their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle sticks .
at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neuer , however , there was forgiveness .
for example , when he had a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ ered ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola made a quad@@ ru@@ ple chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola op@@ ted against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the s@@ wollen Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still set one on it .
in front of the game it has come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly displac@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern Fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , do not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ F@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis qu@@ itting smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to frequent fl@@ esh@@ ing@@ itis in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to high age according to our findings .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of pl@@ ung@@ lessness was affected by DI@@ F@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter resi@@ dues from late antique Cologne on the Rhine river
for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological finds have been made .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have du@@ g skel@@ et@@ ons and remn@@ ants of historical buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all construction projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a specialist for arch@@ eological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found five .
text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs which probably belonged to the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private lighting facilities for disputes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
T@@ TIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to raise appe@@ als against pre@@ judi@@ ces .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on the refer@@ ee , an im@@ possibility against their verdi@@ cts did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work according to their own information on an international investment court .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded above all ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism , on which companies can reimbur@@ se damages to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , lift out national laws or reduce the reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations , such as Camp@@ act , marked the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission considers essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Association BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart stands on which the shy Fol@@ ks@@ änger has recorded the picturesque US State Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells the story of different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative man .
with the 2003 release and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs , which are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ our of &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dist@@ orted series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact on expectations .
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Il@@ linois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece is published in 2005 .
thinking about ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
after a very productive experiment , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic inter@@ sections .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs got out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distin@@ c@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ened album .
one can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can thus throw the plate in the bottom . &quot;
only in addition to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens is modest , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually tends to be thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the prime minister , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut
the new president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to give his debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is probably tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from the proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ DOG on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ated the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles of titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour Chair to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit for winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and retirement minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour Party , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the question of the prime minister is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; perc@@ us@@ sions &quot; and the stri@@ ker with hooks and instead decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub @-@ house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the question of the prime minister . but a few years later , he cleared up that he failed .
since it was first broadcast in television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership under his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharp@@ ly after data indicating a rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and acquired ass@@ essments over the time of an increase in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % leap after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining industry said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock selling as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the Packaging and Paper Group Mond@@ i were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports adhesive company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

like Wik@@ t@@ oria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ t@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the bending construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ t@@ oria would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
school obligation ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans are not .
even Bie@@ ber does not .
it has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertising in the promotional break of the Super@@ ship he has three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company sp@@ elled many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like it and about the counter , Bie@@ ber also assi@@ sts .
if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you mar@@ vel at the window pane .
he is supposed to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber was just in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , don &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to Pot@@ ato dome idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both - and in the Kartoffel@@ keller , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster using a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen on TV .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese in the meantime has become registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contain , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
also with his customers the culinary understanding of international understanding is good .
Met@@ cash Beg@@ ins Ground St@@ ability Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Al@@ di@@ - On@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes more details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy .
there is a lot on the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five per cent of the food market in these two states after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing assets , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction in sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ vor@@ des in hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading san@@ itation programs are to be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis ban Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; fell into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious debate of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying session in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp war@@ med a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty fru@@ strated is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled down a little into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ gios in the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not all of the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think that Nick made a very quick way to get rid of people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares Emer@@ gency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ gh@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that attempted to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a landing strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deployment police .
some reported from Prot@@ est foods and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block with a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ l@@ apping Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would take more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from his neighbors .
the emergency unit called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison camps were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for condemned human tra@@ ffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared &quot; emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded in entering but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ election elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more independent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and men , but these projec@@ tions have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders only comes back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a great advantage over the older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and more 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only a quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers predi@@ ct that they are supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their pointed candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , it is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
with Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
agreement to deal with problems and vot@@ ability are also quoted .
as the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office into the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ election elections would like to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best in hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the term of office as an external minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no implications for Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Clinton is considered hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of the eligible vot@@ ers do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the voting rights also see Tr@@ ump as not hon@@ estly and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes in leadership .
from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates now accounts for half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and over@@ sees tr@@ ump in rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the deepest , and 10 % support last month at 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - it lands with 19 % support in rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at one last week , Car@@ son found a few side @-@ hi@@ sts for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find hot water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
the Mediterranean Sea continues to offer swimming pool temperatures : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and report@@ edly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , to address his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members , utensils , began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ nor Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the sham@@ ans every year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ erable attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or officially - has been sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ wed its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase of interest comes , and the hou@@ sings will come down , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came to the first rate of interest within just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , alb@@ eit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so severely stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the entire excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at the historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest expenses can be volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to be vac@@ ated between 12 and 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study to what happens after interest in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in recent six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob Dol@@ l , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not before and which could ha@@ sten a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants had made a net interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures Trading only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all cycle cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the firm income was volati@@ le as the market decl@@ ines a interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
loans seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the increase the bond returns immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy .
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
in the large and complete , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts are of different opinions , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the member of the board Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of his &quot; stupid &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ Kolle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading parliament member and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham said that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works on behalf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tough@@ er must be worked to engage the public as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added that he wanted the company to be &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; if the next time a series of entertainment was held .
however , he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slo@@ wed the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago as a buyer began to buy purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is c@@ ited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers ran around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , purch@@ as@@ ers to make purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 issues a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the way to pay tribute to their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession went on to the holy place where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then pl@@ ung@@ ing on the beds .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King sent over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction imposed .
the bodies of 29 dec@@ ors who were killed as a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
among the dead Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group did not have to steal the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not tell this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner court of the Groß@@ mos@@ h@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not at their disposal for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged behind
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nation@@ wide
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its will put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you are sent sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
the British increasingly employ craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the tree market chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in store are hit by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more feminine single households than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly to a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial position .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and the turnover after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
due to the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt Regional Court , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich / Do@@ b have to answer because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ integration .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ants were cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial difficulties .
this was the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argu@@ ed that at no time an asset was created to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials had only compens@@ ated for revers@@ als and the sports club for whom they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial office .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , in case of financial success , the payout of reimbur@@ sement damages has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the revers@@ al damage was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account .
therefore , even l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts administered the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association was not revealed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not concern itself in detail for financial support , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed that the function@@ ary was justified .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never ordered a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at di@@ ets , he charged € 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual expense has been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were after an audit , in which everything had been assessed correctly , no longer had been kept , declared .
o@@ dom@@ um money also referred to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all dwell@@ ings are made in cash , so that he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard delivers more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel breakdown that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) will not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients .
this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided by the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ .000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had about 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share amounted to 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services continued the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the quarter at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just about 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry with a split and massive footprint .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded very late to buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more stores now online .
in total , Whit@@ mans restructuring plans see the reduction of around 55@@ .000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat missions in Iraq would predominantly be rep@@ udi@@ ated : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent showed themselves .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria will find 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad lean 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : abor@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ werfer to several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind this , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water laun@@ cher .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially sat uns@@ af@@ e pep@@ per@@ spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees came together and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is watching when the US st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view , was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will still remain somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will be held .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank leaves the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are good against such a step .
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm C@@ ET on Thursday .
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left debt relief
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but that nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers killed him .
University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday said , &quot; There is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married seven years ago as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed at the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 , such as his li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood at the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug ownership .
all this certainly challenges his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large Group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
there is , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings &apos;s cheap subsidiary .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Management Board at Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents the three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot @-@ cleaning cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike stopped .
that shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as fast as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes over the past few months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept is in the background .
it fores@@ ees that Lufthansa will reloc@@ ate to the Group &apos;s own equity line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer defender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg action and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then playing fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an elite meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an elf and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover from June to the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that moved to another direction , so it looked as if he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ spiel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead publishes a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an unknown boy , like the local environment , h@@ ears stri@@ ck@@ ering On@@ ce @-@ lers , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , sn@@ ur@@ ry creature , &quot; which is speaking in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a child .
a down@@ ing street spokesperson said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to push to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th resig@@ ns from the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ eer is geared towards results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their best vot@@ ers .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even though he did not deliver so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer whom I set up high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved a lot of space on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but of course it depends on the creation of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I don &apos;t have anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred orders immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer .
the nom@@ ination of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Col@@ l@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team actors don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain from the EU ) could win an allowance if the economy is in a fl@@ au@@ te until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ ev@@ aded new strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which has been severely dem@@ ol@@ ished because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at asser@@ ts that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from our own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
my European friend , who wishes an outside Britain within the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bla@@ zing force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally do not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process is supposed to susp@@ end my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a bank@@ rupt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the new negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not in 1975 during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ist who has made a name as a &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his absur@@ dity Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ inv@@ it@@ ators who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , it is better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened him a backdoor .
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly hook on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time left for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ stoff tendency and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a shadow Chancellor a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the mou@@ th@@ less bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all things in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding facility of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis , &quot; at which he justified his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , adding them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes than a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were premature .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already re@@ acted to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former Head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the kind of programs sent not by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned or sent , which were also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think medium @-@ term or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least give his production to programs that do not make others or give them an order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the am@@ bition of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think of all that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume a lot from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have grown wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by frac@@ tures of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the activation of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California , said the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically altered the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ phones and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ Genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent to the desired location in the brain at a optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the indicated human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

they played with the invention of a more realis@@ tically z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ epr@@ int with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es von Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is a step forward by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I went to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have been angry - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ sp@@ elling to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to be wat@@ ered : people tell where you are coming from where you come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither hate nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes fell on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers were .
let people leave .
the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks recipes , film night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and get their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not think about starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture which can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from speed - and send it a text message instead .
speaking of apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the peak of Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you anchor .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say that they themselves serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior .

terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , tann@@ ing operators
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
that is , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ bet@@ dien@@ er alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and good price today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper accommodation can be created : it builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are going to push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great deal here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of residen@@ ces .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building instructions complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have drawn up my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch arrangement .
cre@@ amy .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a semi @-@ detached house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not ti@@ ghten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but it was built in luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the Mer@@ ciful .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able through the dis@@ connection of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued since the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton just a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Zwei@@ te stressed before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite already won seven of the current twelve season races and takes the flo@@ od@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in attack .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still un@@ clear .
for days a Dun@@ st@@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened up a new place at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consult@@ ations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the purchasing market , from now on Sen@@ iors will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and care providers .
we have been working with our out@@ patient care service for years that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new househ@@ ol@@ ade J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the inner city shows both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association &apos;s orientation at the age of : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able chat . &quot;
this means that the social foundation will make a major contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said by the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the petrol station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the yo@@ ung@@ sters and struck this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he initially dismis@@ sed his sacrifice .
from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and went down several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured one went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was re@@ attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a stroke , one exam@@ ines the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too is present .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , lack luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still a half @-@ place to his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arbage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf was pleased with the couple Müller .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover , followed by stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed leading emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged hon@@ orary in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen worked as a doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ mate .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 Euros will get the g@@ arbage in the framework of a funding programme from the local district ( 25@@ ,000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Bernd Bor@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another home practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor could have found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way , still looks at familiar faces : acqu@@ ires the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock formation .
with their par@@ ting end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she sp@@ ears after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to ask an asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that the refugees arriving in Slovenia would continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ in wants to have its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted in the night hours to Tuesday in order to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the near fields of corn .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continued to meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country was reck@@ oned with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought immigrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media in accordance with Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border via Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has added , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .

Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have had a good testimony to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm in Hor@@ gos on Wednesday morning : he is holding the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be about very high refugee figures .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of having gained insights into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the captured information should have been made in the financial markets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately tra@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused continued in the case .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators shall have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their bel@@ ong@@ ings , partly fast pac@@ es , partly comfortably stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city rail@@ ways .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ ong life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of the four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid made aware of this action on its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers spontane@@ ously access@@ es the chal@@ k and the phrase about &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; to &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , there are small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point comes the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , but finally , it is a very personal thing .
the theme of death and death is still suffering with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to opening up the people .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the sterile and fun@@ eral companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to be involved in dying .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce looked for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and had been involved in the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the person concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid may well deal with their job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another wait , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the dying and ob@@ ituaries .
every two years training for new employees is offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ ship transport service .
the company also said they are planning to invest around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
anal@@ ysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent average and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ling transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that earnings before the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields are brought into account if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS that plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research ques@@ tioned anal@@ ysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks demanded anal@@ ysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipment , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to stag@@ n@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent during bo@@ d@@ sourcing , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most awa@@ ited meeting in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spent two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Leit@@ z for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting sa@@ wing is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by unprecedented stimul@@ us by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest of federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ ling the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists allevi@@ ate the impact by ple@@ dging that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Do@@ w Jones Industrial average le@@ aped at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy uph@@ eld the sentence in this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she does not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that it would expect more economic progress this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary .
although the creation of jobs slo@@ wed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation continued under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Do@@ w now around 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff .
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Curr@@ ency Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of Ben S. Bern@@ anke at that time , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion &quot; around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses interest rates , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its mission in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ ammen@@ bruch 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should be prec@@ eded by the time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which also sells to the general public .

there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
the store is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the hall@@ ways .
if the whole purchase makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the c@@ asses and has different mit@@ es options .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is also always happy with her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does the asylum seek@@ ers at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good diet is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest council session , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously lowered without major discussions .
prior to this , the committee had decided to submit an application for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction .
accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof should be built with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; Liber@@ ation , &quot; there was again the roof ti@@ lt , which was prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the building plan - below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof incl@@ ination does not permit &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually goes more restri@@ ctive in the case of liberation .
however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and latitude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall will be presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting on Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the existing internal station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff will be informed of the plans .
the change triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over management from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to appro@@ ve both of the houses until the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the local district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily storage facility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity arises not again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a head doctor for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for instance the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ od@@ ine with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police announced .

how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to young people and thrown their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to violence .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be an active participant , who in fact gest@@ ed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not arrived at home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .

in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the susp@@ ici@@ ans , a crime of crime resulted in the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the arrest warrant that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and killed the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented at the harbour fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a total burden on him .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable ble@@ aching .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this results in a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing . &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 260@@ .000 units are completed .
thus 140@@ .000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ class accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is moving an apartment deficit which becomes bigger from year to year .
currently there were around 7@@ 70@@ .000 living units in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ained by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in large cities .
young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the Fl@@ au@@ te .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start .
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
thus , the land value tax could be dispens@@ ed and the property tax for subsi@@ dised flats may be suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary .
the funding programme for Refu@@ gee Affairs in the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well suited for cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was already completed on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the currently available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be exposed .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia judge cor@@ ridor
there is virtually no escape to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dep@@ ortation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day also su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
most of the media reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and ta@@ xis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ fields should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border , there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 366 men of aggression .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday , there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws en@@ force the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; established a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important passage of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers are to be dep@@ orted thi@@ ther .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the g@@ arbage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recept@@ ac@@ les in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday , when ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday but for them in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and took the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we had the un@@ expect@@ edly neglec@@ ted guests , with a snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved to a regional train in W@@ els from a ICE in the direction of Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to try over the border .
but the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp to help establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor officially and publicly placed the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
suffering of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter @-@ resistant quart@@ ets
Konrad has all hands full to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is accust@@ omed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to impose quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great whir@@ l@@ wind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a need of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ .000 lo@@ dg@@ ings have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; Hel@@ ps &quot; as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times , it cannot be that trans@@ duc@@ ers have to keep a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards need to be considered for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he is more successful in placing an accommodation , based Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of the truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cost the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
so far the own quest for qu@@ arti@@ llery has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz demands a better division
first of all , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently under@@ estimate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism is carried by the City Princip@@ al to the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the protective seek@@ ers were brought to Germany by regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
from the ou@@ tset S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are located in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now grew up in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , facing the business in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been thinking if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large @-@ room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I am suitable most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the woman with last safety .
perhaps it is because a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself to foreign enemies , journalists are concerned or reveals gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is stir@@ ring up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ hair@@ ur is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants site are about -@@ zig corners related to it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an entertaining documentary film about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz ranks as well .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a great mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group was the first purchase in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland was failed at the Bavarian State where the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once def@@ ended without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ ls , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so fur@@ ious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension @-@ host@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz ended with a visit something for the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would be better if he won &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump long , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , even in the United States the interest w@@ akes up .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since the Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap closed to the Sun@@ rise in recent months .
compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise , Today &apos;s 3@@ 30,000 reached an average of 3@@ 30,000 in August .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 ran .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of packages from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father who decides to settle with his two children at the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics asked if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and the second half hour was 7@@ 20.000 .
average number of hot @-@ seat 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute which did not manage to over@@ leaf Mc@@ Gu@@ ires &apos;s show .

the last three matches : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally give an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the finale on Thursday
all three women have decided in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become per@@ plex@@ ed who won the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 am .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a triangle as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to get a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of remin@@ ding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian favour had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn cl@@ au@@ r in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get ver@@ tig@@ ations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the Free elec@@ torate conven@@ es on Friday until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum hop@@ pers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used nation@@ ally uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more hand@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long lasting bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , cult minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mid Level plus &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ al middle stage of three is tested for four years - in the result it takes nine years to finish .
but that is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before they got back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to them that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the M@@ ati@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been centr@@ alised for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators voted in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
planned is a mixture of trade , commerce and housing - but there are still no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
it is waiting for appropriate offers , called it by the city .
which investor is in question , is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , already bought some months ago and let the building be disman@@ tled .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday housing estate at the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
for months it was negoti@@ ated behind closed doors , stir@@ red , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new vacation settlement at the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ der Council .
originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
for months , the project has been in discussion for about ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ ds that came into the meeting called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
in addition , he fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the system : &quot; all the bus charges must come so that it will be reck@@ oned , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well one h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to aid the $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , was about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many refugees also flee from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , Adi@@ posit@@ as sur@@ geri@@ es have proved efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been carried out in people who are ill @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those under@@ going this surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , diabetes was completely only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results from the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better found in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical treatment group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the Swedish study , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight serious once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have established their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is currently taking into consideration in Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader asked to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under certain circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries was ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reported to report po@@ ison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more frequent to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children can deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
yo@@ ung@@ sters have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be spot@@ ted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children a few sprit@@ zer can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered drunk by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sounded her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and storage of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths were associated with alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York were planning to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by providing anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police looked at the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous plan as &quot; guard &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not only talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now points out at the top of the table with five points .
Dei@@ la said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we need to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now to stand together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the U@@ Ks , as the figures of the office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a ma@@ ier lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she admitted that &quot; it would have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be objec@@ tively objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can turn to it .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police chase persu@@ aded to come from the Cann@@ ing River

an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the Police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday at a home peace breakdown incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards attempted to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sample of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to be &quot; looked like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to go around my head , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m doing my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should surely touch their nos@@ es , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I believe that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps do people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the beaten Master Black Caviar , described the racing day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has mistakenly applied mud onto the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was also on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy cri@@ tici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the storm players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ ce note to the Storm Team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the fli@@ cker of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his crew felt confident , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always emerg@@ es - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ fights when they hit us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we did not change anything about our def@@ ensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accust@@ omed to losing so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this time is coming up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George has been critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think about us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks do and don &apos;t have any points of tension@@ ing ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with 200,000 $ deposit for drug ad@@ diction
a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America about Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the original explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice Flan@@ ag@@ an said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , regi@@ strated by the police every day and stops at an outlet of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driving cab out@@ lines apart
on Tuesday evening a truck driver was severely injured during a col@@ lision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment , as the police split .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident damage plan is completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 am .
a damage occurred in the amount of EUR 12@@ 2,000 .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone by girls to attract p@@ ests to send images
a p@@ est hel@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when it was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ related pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police looked around and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ est in the internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying .
she then looked at the in@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having recorded un@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , on 25 January of this year , and did not appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one can argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; was found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disc@@ erns the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted a ref@@ und@@ able deposit , but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings .
he was still recorded before the date of the verdi@@ ct into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tra@@ ctors soft to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken out of the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tra@@ ctors made out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border transi@@ tions
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn district along the river river Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and dust to the German side .
there they will be picked up by German polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police , the Munich Central Station showed again significantly more refugees in comparison with the weekly start of the weekend .
at 8@@ am , some 700 people arrived in the capital city , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
following the rein@@ tro@@ duction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : runner from Tro@@ pen@@ storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the un@@ for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is also possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see circle with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 hours .
on Friday , the sun can no longer be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the highway at the I@@ AA show its novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , this is mainly due to movement among the compact cars , which are currently particularly well being sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations fell to this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( public holidays from 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented in this year between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel presents a entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost you 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also among them .
in contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door Opel Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is also visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is shown at the I@@ AA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger was placed on the front part of the front : here , the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class there are a number of over@@ work and new variants , such as the spot@@ ted Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial exec@@ ution@@ ary Te@@ gel , who was in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant had failed due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the Land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Jud@@ ge raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons for the same period only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , there was a compensation for compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be an exac@@ erb@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court now has to clear the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only spoke to a prisoner of damage in April because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multi@@ layer allocation of a cell is also un@@ worthy without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 , a decent housing .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to bats , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places in the Te@@ gel are not occupied for young people , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different prognos@@ es between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing but especially at affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 housing apartments fall out of the rental price and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification in order to help them start their entry , Claudia Walter cri@@ tici@@ zed the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from labour ban for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fl@@ atten@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration is divided into different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is growing strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , as well as teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land is forbidden to asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but has abandoned his attitude .
student @-@ willing refugee could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or divor@@ ce do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , if they start studying .
the latter generally won &apos;t get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ers .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely succ@@ umb to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ churches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to evol@@ ve into a new state religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
in this way the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent .
as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a general equ@@ ation law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU M@@ ord@@ Series showed systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the stak@@ eholder groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical attention to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money would have to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests to susp@@ end all contact persons at the registration health cards .
delivered services could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to check out as many people with the limited performance catalog , which see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise the doctors make the language barriers to create .
already so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more informed about their illnesses than other patients .
interpre@@ ting costs must not only be taken over in clinics , even in medical practices .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
for example , there is much more im@@ pover@@ ished disability among refugees , and among the young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
with some of the other diseases , German doctors came out of their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery thinks .
&quot; paras@@ it@@ aries or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as for the doctor , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees .
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
up to now only four per cent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can provide an application for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

the aim is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst will invite you to the man@@ ege on a brick @-@ v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
thus , the gift to the Cel@@ esti@@ al family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday life and bring them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family pul@@ ls the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is said to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ eness .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ icycle ?
for He Yuan no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ understand@@ ings in the posture of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read from the eyes according to the possibility .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the supreme command therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid j@@ um@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived eight years in a walk and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little j@@ um@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with their whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst will invite you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal @-@ show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ g@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen .
last month , they had spread it out and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; Tod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and will focus on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the latest Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old sw@@ ung during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 b@@ uns in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs who have seen most injury days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury ratio will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a reasonable period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to treat a small break @-@ up break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured by the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by a distant hope , with his management to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ aming .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ess and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone past@@ oral care explained to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listeners role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ ordered has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PSG to rent Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master to the road , but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Donetsk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish masters , since they are not only striving for the kno@@ cks for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the first le@@ ague , but he was stung by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine wing storm was called the man to take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in Manchester United last month , and he pointed out why when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic hit in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , he sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half by no less than five attempts alone , after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute passed by the pole ...
the second door finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved his sixth seasonal actor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended up all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was det@@ ained at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we played only in Swedish le@@ ague which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , has collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday , with a stock selling as part of its huge debt plan .
the London registered company Gl@@ enc@@ ore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ to pay off their own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , fights with falling raw material prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to wi@@ pe around one third of its 30 billion dollars debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other raw material prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit in Washington
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and is rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral topics of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to design areas of dis@@ agreements construc@@ tively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding the alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times podium winner , four times champion @-@ le@@ ague winner , two times champion champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already standing in front of the EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we do nothing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason why X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has paid me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the whole distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in the film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she doesn &apos;t need them behind the scenes .
during a follow @-@ up of the Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ went the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian established themselves .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white stallion .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 retin@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nation@@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism .
in February the singer Prince gave a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; album silent matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ters have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to fin@@ als .
the last task was to climb a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended up the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenging three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great gra@@ tification .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;ll get some res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers pass on Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
previously , they once were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s wast@@ ed a chance to climb within a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American le@@ ague game .
for Det@@ roit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Det@@ roit sc@@ ored three times in the first two quarters , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested six times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first races since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has cur@@ ated the wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked significantly better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh core , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down wall , the only man faced with whom he was faced , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who plan a Two @-@ Run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion Run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Det@@ roit , at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , added a Insurance @-@ Run , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Det@@ roit benef@@ ited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers put in the second one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ k@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ lder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective look@@ out . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive expansion of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it has already given immediate talks between the General Director for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
concrete figures did not call them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial recording and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , do these also .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a huge force effort .
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from extending extending over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , because e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants reported on their way to the Greek border .

under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean oscill@@ ates .
this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; room .
according to this , the moon is easily tra@@ vers@@ ed around the ring plan@@ ed .
although this pi@@ geon movement is only small but still too big for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
thus , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must think of course now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious burden .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them include B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor Beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports visual , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ y salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first F@@ illing Tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz was wed@@ n@@ esday on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair dri@@ es partly with storm @-@ strength through the F@@ öhn@@ tä@@ ler .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings strong ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind arches and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west flow .
on the mountain@@ side of the Alps , the night will break through the valleys on Wednesday night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land , partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can penetrate in places to the adjacent middle and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ ons of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on wed@@ n@@ esday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer@@ y temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to sto@@ w at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after the last days have already fallen large amounts of rain .
on Thursday morning , the air dri@@ es out the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind blows strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures go far back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of town president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now known as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often able to live their faith in secret over the centuries as a minority .
with the place become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a sin@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther initiated the split of the evening church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but it is not at all syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it may seem quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles devoted to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood .
he has been fascinated by several partners spontane@@ ously : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has separated himself on the basis of painting with the respective biblical passages .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quote of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on to work with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is that the art in the quick@@ est time is again becoming more important : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , to let them look , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image seeks its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how to understand life with his paintings . &quot;
I have not paid attention to the Bible to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected for it important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .

om@@ issions in politics and administration were concerned , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill dep@@ orted , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first public minister Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to share in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; another commem@@ oration &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany , and the policy ass@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the problems arising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say that I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for each individual to get the grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wanted to help .
but the decisive course must face politics .
the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine show a clear sign when they are on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their locations had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the association provides 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye on accident
according to Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ shed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out on the street - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you are fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback made by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its tri@@ bal elf on the re@@ us position .
he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master man Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all European le@@ ague games , Tu@@ chel left open .
with high probability he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ tist Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , maintains Mittel@@ feld@@ webel Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot@@ ics cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological pione@@ ers in the change of the automobile .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast moving on digital radio communications .
testing new technology is currently developing a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will the Federal Government review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use for example international that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention that previously only sees the human being as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show will result in the fact that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars are going through in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all to believe 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital composite Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey across all roads .
on the auto@@ bahn , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
well , every V@@ oting would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of September 25 - October 4 , Düssel@@ dorfer wants to strike in sing@@ les only in sing@@ les from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is to fall on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor mine in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , we are no longer a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Individual @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Tran@@ scription Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown on 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his / her attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was carried out : in order to refres@@ h the dol@@ ls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged .
the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich according to details of the cur@@ ator .
shortly before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , G@@ aul@@ tier said .
G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious fashion attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he used his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said G@@ aul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the horror of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them naturally .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , worked on blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past stit@@ ches , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ j@@ ail Pl@@ auen is a member of the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private shops and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
today , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , the import of exports , currently to Russia and in the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that demonstrates that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg outdoor office of the West@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to oppose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter animated textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ members the historical snow@@ ball tip .
the machine rocks small chi@@ cks at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; I could not do anything before using traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of pl@@ ough - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a souven@@ ir .
so I see my jewellery as modern amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends should not be touched , but Disney is still struggling with a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should endeav@@ our to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for controlling the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments .

in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mercury threshold in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and increase the consumption of consumers &quot; significantly higher doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are so strongly bur@@ dened with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be non @-@ pol@@ ite .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this however as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemetery @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system in particular .
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury enters the environment mainly due to coal combustion .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations met Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount paid in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish around Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from the paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
