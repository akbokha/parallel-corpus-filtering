Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during the meeting , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution under discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing housing development and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
with the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was partly rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with regard to the election forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor decides to have shot his girl@@ friend
in a distress call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family ties of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note written on a white souven@@ ir sheet : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University policy chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
by the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes sevent@@ een members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee of an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
in spring he did his doc@@ torate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of Friend@@ ship Lam@@ bs has described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the women &apos;s flock .
all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson outskirts of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no proof of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail two years ago appeared on a summer carni@@ val .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night ton@@ ight 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , pres@@ ided over the sem@@ esters program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle @-@ light memorial service on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes are res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; LA@@ FOR@@ GE said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us is planning to hire less workforce for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it will not hire as many Christmas season associates as last year , but toy and baby products retail@@ er says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and sales centres across the country . in 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 employees were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays itself are still months away , the Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to employ temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox tells about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it makes sense to me that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and an arm length of being with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The biggest time travel film ever shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be released on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the edge of the meeting of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation unten@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the wake of the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks during pol@@ ls , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no one claims Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump &apos;s staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa reported last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two out of ten say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish vot@@ ers ten@@ ding to Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the country &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they put up their hat@@ s , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers Tr@@ umps campaign is plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still propos@@ ing almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before E@@ ach Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they match Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign led immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , the immigration turning point in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is far from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration is in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new highest levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday &apos;s pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious in Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive apartment complex - with a view over the North Sea a@@ watt .
on the street , one square metre of a roof@@ ing house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows which special layers a square metre costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really limited .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living standards , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there have been several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , safely .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the head of any exception here .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ times sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ e hits ( 8 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth jump success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was rewarded with the assistance of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who took part in a flan@@ k of the World Champion during his 28th visit to the Champions League for Bayern .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the play at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word .
they showed a focused and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including prestigious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , there was also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they proce@@ eded cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ vari@@ ably to work with their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by bac@@ kl@@ ash on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which seldom came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field on the left upper edge of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer , Ide@@ ye Brown stroke the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although Bavaria with@@ drew its usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set needle stit@@ ches .
but on fool@@ ish@@ ly Manuel Neuer was reli@@ eved .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5 ) .
before new , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; said Sports Board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the s@@ wollen Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put one on it .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly mu@@ te Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ Ter@@ m Study .
good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is what emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of teeth bal@@ dness are ca@@ vi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ R .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ sizes the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of ca@@ vi@@ ties .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment sink to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Dr. Thomas Dietrich from the Birmingham University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good oral health up to old age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of unemployment have been affected by the DI@@ F@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late antique town of Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the first time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological research .
in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists now found five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman died at the railway station in the shi@@ ms of the Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police appe@@ als to the population for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crosses the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
by collecting the train , she has suffered severe injuries by the federal police .
she was treated as a doctor and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance specialists .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no re@@ aliz@@ ations to the peti@@ t officials .
the incident was perhaps witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to def@@ use the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( T@@ TIP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in turn corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly selected independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
until now the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , a possibility of ob@@ jection to their verdi@@ ct did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented .
in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court according to their own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to the T@@ TIP .
the traditional Arb@@ it@@ ration Cour@@ ts are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , on which companies can pol@@ lu@@ te damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , un@@ le@@ ash national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in initial comments anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act reported inadequate proposals by the European Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ ined ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged thereby .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have run since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is no longer valid .
Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy working folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative mis@@ er .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; sounds smart composed songs , which nest@@ le harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into a great opul@@ ent at all times .
the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be swe@@ pt away .
but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive view .
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; Il@@ linois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a comprehensive masterpiece .
over@@ board of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) to perform very extensively of electronic inter@@ sections .
this sixth overall studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but played by sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have long gone , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
actually Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band in Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; which has been available since March .
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk .
without jud@@ ging a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide @-@ enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can destroy the &quot; record . &quot;
only for an enc@@ ore St@@ ev@@ ens would like to say thanks , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows to thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Fra@@ cture of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire since his election .
the new president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and will join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to post the first of his six given questions just after noon , and his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to pers@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary Party supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also &quot; pil@@ ing up &quot; within the Labour &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of win@@ nings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach says that he has given &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from strike and strike , and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea into talking that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ theater , &quot; often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his position under his fellow parliament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased mark@@ edly by data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Nutrition target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period in the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est rate since 2009 and has brought in@@ estim@@ ations at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over from the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry securities were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - are reporting growth again .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the stocks of the Mond@@ i packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sport increased by 3.1 % after the sport@@ scar company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of JD Sport states that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the CEO of JD Sport Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sport , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
for 21 years young , a ham@@ mer@@ ing with a sky@@ rock@@ eting touch .
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the Generation U@@ 17 is rotating .
how Vik@@ t@@ oria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ t@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates at the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the bending construction : here her i@@ dol res@@ ides , whose posters hang in st@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ t@@ oria would have to sit in high school in the tenth class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her a dream . &quot;
school obligation ?
who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber himself does not .
it has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertising in the commercial break of the Super@@ market he assi@@ mil@@ ated three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ pe@@ de company donated many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also c@@ assi@@ sts .
when Jus@@ tin drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber finally came to No. 1 in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato d@@ öner .
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - in the potato öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ accommodation Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; on a Peg@@ ida movement poster , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea gave him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on TV .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer is turning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea was to register Leban@@ ese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains .
just as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary understanding of the international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash launches Ground Defense Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di On@@ ce
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a stance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale distributor of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot on the game because South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing assets , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley said that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and metal cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA after the next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts sold on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business fell by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has been decl@@ ining from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with col@@ es and v@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast @-@ growing fresh food and providing a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programmes are being put to an end and hopes that in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo called &quot; Special Ks , &quot; was spot@@ ted by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison cri@@ tici@@ zed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to strike Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a crash hit a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single after Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m rather en@@ vious of is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a m@@ allet out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too ti@@ ghtly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision that Kyr@@ gy@@ z should not take into account the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick made the climb very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , where he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who were trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants depos@@ ited in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and the Serbian officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and shou@@ ted ins@@ ults against the Hungarian army police .
some returned from Prot@@ est food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister stated it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more of Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not reconc@@ ile common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ run Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would make that the EU countries would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an offensive action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency state called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and become the entry point to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most arriving economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher adhesion pen@@ alties for condemned human tra@@ ffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares its emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen many armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security couns@@ ell@@ or for Or@@ ban , said that authorities hit 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push in there .
around 20 succeeded to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground against her .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent rise ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies .
more than five months before the beginning of the primar@@ ies , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projec@@ tions have decreased .
their support among the men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage among older vot@@ ers .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she was nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they wouldn &apos;t support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter she would enthusias@@ tically support .
while 48 percent of the Democra@@ t vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted .
since vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s followers more than half said that Bi@@ den would be her second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for nomin@@ ating the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has declined by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bees are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the key features of vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
in general , democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the term of office as Secretary of State , most Democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still had deteri@@ or@@ ated .
they are mainly Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not regard them as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to vote nation@@ ally also see tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were the best candidates for hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than frank@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 German vot@@ ers in the primar@@ ies is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son pi@@ cks up with a nation@@ wide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
meanwhile , half of the support of the vot@@ ers is in the new pol@@ l , and others lose a dramatic halt .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers still support tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but in the same period , Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump with rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows Car@@ son rises in the surveys - it ends with 19 % support among rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump far ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found a few side hi@@ ves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find still warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bathing temperature continues to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is coming to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and princip@@ ally set the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Police Chief Wagner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt power injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the sham@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe suggested a charge of murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ guided attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for it , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise of interest comes , and the domestic demand is stag@@ gering , yields for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first compo@@ unding and lasted for 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising interest rates is often , alb@@ eit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement might be over@@ done because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a view based on historical trends how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to reduce assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a more recent study on what is going on after inser@@ ting the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average rate of return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , published by Bob Dol@@ l , plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , near Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on loans therefore begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 rate of interest had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and wait for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
interest rate increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and pose the question as to whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have been prepared to adver@@ tise the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , Fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights are put into the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated interest rates and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
when bor@@ rowing , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond issues immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Jones suggests that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ates its strategy .
in large and over , companies that handle the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products .
multination@@ als with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after initial interest rates , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed average by 5 percentage points after each interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high @-@ level yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
saver could see gains by higher yields , even if experts are of different opinion how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; mu@@ ff@@ ling &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also c@@ ited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice announced that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also featured BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be only one of the names of The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismis@@ sed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works on commission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that it was necessary to work harder to engage the public than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 wasn &apos;t the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins has attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sting that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; when the next time there was a serie of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the revenue pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew slower in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slo@@ wed the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has ero@@ ded , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total spending for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , that has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now we are comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will be reduced .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times sharp the average number of buyers around their computers to make their gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium revealed that £ 5 spending was spent more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than a third of the purchases are now carried out through Web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane crash killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia in part puts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health also said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ura cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession went on to the holy place where only days earlier a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi king hung over the construction company of the bin Laden as a result of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when it was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Pri@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , which was later this month .
the bin Laden group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ duc@@ ed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project conducted by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

this means that 200 additional scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ men , are opened .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q show@@ cases nation@@ wide close
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef dent of Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the deployment of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully b@@ yp@@ assed with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , today you seem to be a minority .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans in order to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new manager of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led .
King@@ f@@ isher therefore plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and close up to 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this more strongly towards equilibrium .
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , also re@@ stru@@ cts their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decrease in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
due to the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ ley crew A@@ ich / Do@@ b have to answer due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this alle@@ g@@ ation in May .
the current process was adj@@ our@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , it was clear that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used money from club accounts which they had been allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was due to the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the alle@@ g@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argu@@ ed that no asset had been added to the association at any time .
the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession , major char@@ tered account@@ ants of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have invested money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said in cash on delivery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , only debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , some of the repar@@ ations have been paid out only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus on the account has been paid off .
therefore , tim@@ pan@@ i and not detailed bookings appeared , the former Chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and accounts held the two def@@ end@@ ants together , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ements were not covered by the association in detail , asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial link@@ age , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account , against which a function@@ ary investigation started .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account expi@@ red on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ accused would have been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
the function@@ ary said he never got a cent salary , he simply calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged € 1,000 per month for di@@ ets , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to demonstrate precise documents for the early years .
they were no longer retained after an audit in which everything was assessed correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ um money also referred to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the dwell@@ ings have to be made in cash , so that he must go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard puts more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been running for three years , the computer terri@@ fic will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs for the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share received 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the group , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led into a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC @-@ maker to Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ stan@@ sions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more transactions online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans en@@ vis@@ age the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq , however , would predominantly be rejected : 54 per cent contra@@ di@@ ct , 35 per cent agreed .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cooperation with Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad would reject 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 66@@ th I@@ AA
the focus of the fair will be on 27 September , connected cars and electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the slogan &quot; Mobility Com@@ bin@@ ed &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : breaking out of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and laun@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police officers stood a police station and a flo@@ od@@ light was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers were initially un@@ interrup@@ ting Pep@@ per@@ spray .
the police then used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now rec@@ eded a little while waiting .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US dollar bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that was last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less st@@ ress@@ ful outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 PM C@@ ET on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left exc@@ use letter
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called on the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he had shot on a man , and killed any one .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police watched the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen re@@ treated him .
President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb met relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm

in 2001 , he fought against Leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession .
all this surely calls for its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost group conversion work .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and re@@ alizes the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate an income contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt , Managing Director Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been a strong company .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike had been stopped .
this was shared by the union .
the subject of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit wanted to come with a projected record result as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; saving concept .
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa is shifting routes to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this made the left foreign defender crying and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg action and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s hard to play and then fantas@@ tically plays , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape from a Red Card and the Suspension of a El@@ f@@ nm .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty difference and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United inv@@ ents the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg breaking when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad wound , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad with it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President ruled for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , re @-@ releases an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partially read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is ra@@ v@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ need kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , sn@@ y@@ er@@ ous creature saying , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twice in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s bal@@ lot office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th is dischar@@ ged from the UK test cad@@ re and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to ski@@ p Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket player is focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago we would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopefully turns out any further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even though he didn &apos;t get such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I love highly .
he is an X factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he sc@@ ored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would give an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , emerged and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred laps immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few smart supplements at the training station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ de , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the timet@@ able .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Drop Out of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain allo@@ wan@@ ces if the economy becomes a Fl@@ au@@ te until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s dis@@ gor@@ ged new strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which has fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in different crises , how the EU is now and not always on its own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes , which they mostly do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , looking for Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells us that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the long run @-@ out such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a for@@ f@@ ading power .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan on helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him rather than to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 which opened a backdoor .
the press has never with@@ drawn it either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p traditional blue @-@ arb@@ ore@@ al tendencies and the wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C said to his fellow campaig@@ ners and MPs in all reports on their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the thr@@ illing bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite government economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called itself .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
statements of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) developed Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month launched the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation &quot; based on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the testim@@ oni@@ als of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 atten@@ de@@ es at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the funding it was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco leadership of P@@ he took part .
the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to stop smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is proof of evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger in comparison with tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking the National Health System costs two billion pounds a year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up on the East , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they have seen public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ fought contemporary window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ders like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly shown by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give its production to programs that others do not do or give in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funding programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I need to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for ass@@ essments &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will return what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ In@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows should sell like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public N@@ ine programs should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion radio , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think we all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume a lot of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , explaining and enter@@ tained &quot; to the public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful are shown on TV , and deal with the commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes are changing the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have grown wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes ri@@ pen the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the activation of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ oni found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ azi@@ oni gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ phones and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the altered mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ azi@@ oni said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the silence that prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the weapons trade - through a laying of the ex @-@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical advertising , but &quot; through the bl@@ ond with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old , I went to a residence hall , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I was up@@ set - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly ner@@ ve@@ able to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to d@@ wat@@ ery : people tell where you &apos;re coming from , whether and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ron , where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither hate nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were fl@@ ared and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress up and adjust their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking at him .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship C@@ lose through B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people fall asleep when you drop .
to steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , if they did something to make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , separate yourself and see them every day and perhaps witness how they all common friends come across ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is more fine than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - never give someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .

the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner built terra@@ ced houses for people in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still build a good and good job today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds up terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : a mass housing in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in dwell@@ ings .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say that it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have carried out my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch arrangement .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not true .
but do you not tough@@ en up the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more have been built .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the needy .
I &apos;ll show how you can still build cheap and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting Apps to make room - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . it will also be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your cell phone is charged while updating or is located near a charging device so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the update .

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and seeking information will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nursing staff .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions here .
&quot; neither will many services of the insurance funds be used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Hospital as well as for the Amb@@ ul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment .
the offers of the Seni@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demo@@ graphic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , as the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the opening ceremonies , the district office also devoted itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness of age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the Social Foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus arrived on Tuesday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men undergo 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men cried out to the young man , and struck him with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismis@@ sed from his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a car up to the apartment and went there demon@@ stra@@ tively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male individual .
with the help of a stroke , one applied to the face and thig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
until now , only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor , Gott@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also very happy .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller performs the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel turns into retirement , his successor Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the rock formation years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist education in the dener &apos;s hospital and who also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the idea was to run his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the g@@ arbage cans bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz circle and engaged hon@@ orary in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ er , works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller &apos;s , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be depos@@ ited as hou@@ sings .
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need a talk room .
furthermore , the ED@@ P is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 Euro as part of a funding program of the local district ( 25@@ ,000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , in North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ hausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation , by the way , continues to look especially in familiar faces : acqu@@ ires the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock formation .
with their f@@ arewell a era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the medi@@ cs have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus , sm@@ iling .
a little sad@@ ness has spread it after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum request can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of men stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &apos; cor@@ ridor &apos; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would also let the arriving refugees continue in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to in@@ fer its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian Government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had already attempted to travel by the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d during the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik region .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country will reck@@ on with around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media reported consistent on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to the media reports , at least in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could in fact lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat more far @-@ west distance from the already predicted displacement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic insi@@ sted that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed a good testimony to the country concerning the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees now want to go on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian interior minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he stopped debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature ejaculation .
it would not be a very high rate of refugees at this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot yet say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distribut@@ ing maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously access@@ es the chal@@ k and can read the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not suffering long &quot; adds , others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ association carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid .
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate on the tablets openly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still ha@@ iry with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to opening up the people .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the hon@@ orary employees of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce looked for volunteers by calling , she reported immediately and was there in the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes , and Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another wait , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ners .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body@@ boar@@ der service .
the company also said that it plans to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share ac@@ counted for 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said making a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set , anal@@ ysts expect 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January , and despite higher shipments for bo@@ d@@ cargo shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be charged as of November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that earnings before the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; solid earnings &quot; considering weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations jobs were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex deser@@ ved $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted twelve anal@@ ysts by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six anal@@ ysts asked by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority dispatch , which resulted in sales in his unit Express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the bo@@ d@@ quarter increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit posted higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States stands above them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey cour@@ tro@@ om .
the card is a reminder that the president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented incentive through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets may fri@@ ghten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest in federal bonds - and is just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Do@@ w Jones Industrial average was down by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy uph@@ olds the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position was expected .
although the job creation slo@@ wed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives told that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , although the Do@@ w is now almost 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would raise the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff .
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s official currency authority .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference to the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 meant that the F@@ ed could &quot; close up &quot; its monetary expansion , del@@ igh@@ ting confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments in another place , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA recognized this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
var@@ nis@@ hing , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who uses the Federal Open Market Committee for a raise interest rate , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Mar@@ tian b@@ ail@@ out , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent turbul@@ ences are not coming near this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the involvement of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da too there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 conferences .
every Thursday it does it at the asylum seek@@ ers home at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric company promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to explain to sho@@ cking women how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding times . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary intervention that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited h@@ ello construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt is taking a step forward : in the recent council session , the completed construction application has been unanim@@ ously sealed without major discussions .
prior to this , the Board had , among other things , decided upon an application for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; from a valid building plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction .
according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; is to be erected .
the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; this is why we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; there was again the roof incl@@ ine , which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - different from the z@@ oning plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan does not permit any &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is usually more restri@@ ctive in the case of liber@@ ating orders .
however , during Turn@@ h@@ h@@ bau , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and mass transportation .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Federal Council Office for testing .
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of staff are moving from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s Hospital GmbH , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital would be employed at Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a work@@ station in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the resig@@ nation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses on the inside station .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the local district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renov@@ ations at the Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim have been completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ acted rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal C@@ law , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer over the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; of the employees .
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ usi@@ an with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old promised to kill the young people and threw their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a victim of violence since Saturday .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be active .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the arrest took place in police surveillance to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a total load on him .
information on the immediate circumstances of the act is to bring further investigations .
refugees need lodging : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; Social Housing &quot; Association .
by comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing development policy of the past few years .
Germany is shooting up an apartment deficit , which becomes bigger from year to year .
currently some 7@@ 0,000 housing units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals still lived in big cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tarily more in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the floo@@ ding in the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing &quot; proposes a restart .
new incentives should stimulate social housing development again .
thus , the land purchase tax could be wai@@ ved and the properties for subsidi@@ zed homes will be suspended .
moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are needed .
the subsi@@ dy programme for Refu@@ gee Affairs in the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received by towns and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the currently available EUR 300 million was rec@@ alled on Monday evening at € 184 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up cor@@ ridor
there is practically no going through to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia by setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dep@@ ortation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the eve of the day before .
in addition , new laws which came into force on the same day do not obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately upon arrival they would have tried to get to Croatia by foot over the green border .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across barriers .
for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , hardly any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police had 366 attacked people .
shortly before the closing of the door on Monday we had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws regulate the over@@ coming and damaging of the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
pen@@ alties thre@@ aten adhesion pen@@ alties up to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum claims were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ it@@ onen &quot; set up on the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ it@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the g@@ arbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
scrap skel@@ et@@ ons were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself as the goal of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees arrive at the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government locations .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; after the bridge party on Sunday we were occupied with the ti@@ dying up when ten people suddenly stood at the door of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had suddenly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday but because of the flow of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and picked up the ri@@ ot together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Middle Pass@@ au .
before we first cal@@ med the unexpected guest , with a snack and drink .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in W@@ els , to try it after the short @-@ term pro@@ clam@@ ation that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably joined , Sunday before a Zwei@@ br@@ anded Rail - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor pointed out highly official and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ stan of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suffering of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will have to find that the &quot; praised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter in order to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad at the search for 35@@ .000 har@@ dy quarters
with the support of refugees , Konrad has all his hands to do .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen Bank to set up lo@@ dg@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first emergency centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also accommod@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad comp@@ utes with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , more than 3@@ 5,000 establishments have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily arrange accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing them as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that lo@@ dg@@ ings have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the upper layers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards must be considered for a limited time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful in placing an accommodation , based Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say un@@ tru@@ th@@ fully in the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er did not create any costs for the republic , as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for quarters has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better division
the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to under@@ pin those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
critics practice the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has taken on further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2700 square metre rest area in the building has already been rented , for another 40 percent there will be requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
in fact J@@ utta had wanted to breed a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to post@@ p@@ one this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she gained momentum in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop across the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold were done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the city of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion concern has gotten rid of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am the most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman is wearing a hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce is not able to answer the woman with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it is alien@@ ated , journalists ru@@ de or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ling the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property million@@ aire came from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is well known for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village are related to it over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think those guys find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , however , it tends to be the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a wholesale mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , called &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ makers &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
the tr@@ ump thus comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and in the US opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
real estate was the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements by the descendants .
he repeatedly said about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he says , it &apos;s not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so bri@@ dging . &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the host@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie @-@ singers , also in the USA the interest w@@ akes up .
the Upper Bavarian commun@@ e Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; should have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson split to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to today &apos;s 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today reached a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in recent months Today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today reached an average of 318@@ .000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of packages from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ting Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong at 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quotes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will convince N@@ ine that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which didn &apos;t manage to sur@@ pass the Mc@@ Gu@@ ys show .

the final three match : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery un@@ veiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally get a notice of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have learned ly@@ ric about why wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and observed Sam@@ s &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; would be one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries about his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the two @-@ seater with his original debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Que@@ ens@@ land cry .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay rights

because of the high refugee figures , the Free vot@@ ers call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn sound in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns synago@@ gues , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday faction of Free vot@@ ers conven@@ es on Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free vot@@ ers meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor &apos;s boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum hop@@ pers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need unified standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria li@@ stens away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more effective . &quot;
but the country policy in big Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch stays on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch , &quot; at 47 gramm@@ ar schools , in which an extension of the high @-@ level secondary school will be tested from three to four years .
but that &apos;s not enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools wishing to do so .
free travel at the G@@ 9 wherever desired .

many Bör@@ si@@ ans anticip@@ ate that the markets will take place until after the interest rate decision in the United States and also to the big decline in the fut@@ ures exchanges on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of R@@ WE on a record low and left deep marks on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3@@ 31 per cent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3,@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax point .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend .
according to this , investors are currently receiving too little attention to the German chip maker .
investment in future w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ orting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ s@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the West Nepal from the ethnic group of the Sub@@ arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post@@ al is scheduled to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mix of commerce , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den city wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for corresponding offers , that is , from the city .
which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property located at Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already purchased several months ago and had to tear down the building that is on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday housing estate at the Little Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of An@@ li@@ eger is wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , bel@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday housing estate at the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who submitted sec@@ rec@@ y to investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went from the system building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
for months , the project has been discussing about ten to twelve million euros in the discussion .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ owners who had entered the meeting sum@@ mon@@ ed the images and new details to the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea bu@@ d and a member of the board of advoc@@ ating the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks the other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase dramatically due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus itations must come so that this will be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one h@@ ect@@ are of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; added Ralf Behr@@ ends .
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund@@ raising campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ run by the European Nations , as they are fle@@ eing from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years following a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article about the new study in J@@ AMA .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity treatments for type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight relative to size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital filed data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity treatments - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who had under@@ gone a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ran@@ ged completely and partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison to diabetes , the diabetes was completely only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , says the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone said that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is increasingly noticed in the fiction sector : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , after years finds the flock of her youth again , and this one falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Leader demanded to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which devot@@ es herself to ethics .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing will be less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
toxic Control Centr@@ es in the United States report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic beverages , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting po@@ ison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more frequent to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison@@ ous emergency centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ WIN@@ NER Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah al@@ ighted her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahs &quot; mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants beyond the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was listed as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by reporting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from her room .
the police considered the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous plan as &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; and imposed disciplinary action on the school authority .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ey &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Cel@@ tic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths Pla@@ ys talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glas@@ go@@ w , which was rep@@ elled spontane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under higher control , as they prepare for confron@@ tation with the Dutch tab@@ ular leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ed Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers middle @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch Football fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ company games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , there was a defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stood at the top of the table with five points .
Dei@@ la said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel that exactly , but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton cau@@ tious on January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Mc@@ Inn@@ es was happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen had to struggle with Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh succ@@ essive le@@ ague victory which brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in po@@ isons or le@@ agues that haven &apos;t won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom overall it rises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Schot@@ t@@ ner &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent above that of the U@@ Ks , such as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cs Bureau ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being put to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mate how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she could &quot; better form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police chase persu@@ aded to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ came the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away by a police officer attempting to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the Police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a home peace quar@@ ry event in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
team soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins left his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sound sample in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
ton@@ ight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to move around and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had the bomb to rise in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity section had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to me that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their nos@@ es because they failed in trying to hold me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this make me believe that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L react in a co@@ war@@ dly manner and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and leave me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but now I am at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt analysis at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching stated that he said he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ f@@ aded Master Black Caviar , called the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ a , which b@@ umped against the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it also happened on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has come too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to ring fighting claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has cri@@ tici@@ zed the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the storm players &quot; fight &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely disgu@@ sted note to the storm team after his team finished the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the rug@@ by le@@ ague and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tac@@ kling of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their contact with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the review by two leading trainers in his team made him feel confident because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about mar@@ tial arts when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real center of gravity and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm played against R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Co@@ w@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the storm team has released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ beer with $ 200,000 Deposit after drug ad@@ diction
a man who may have a life @-@ long penalty , because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that he could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the Supreme Court judge , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has a clear relationship with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit under the conditions that he dis@@ covers his austr@@ alian and his Serbian passport , regi@@ sters daily with the police and adher@@ es to an initial lock of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

a truck driver had been seriously injured during a col@@ lision with three trucks on the 5 motorway at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks participated in a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing system completely broke apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to attract p@@ ests to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when she slept in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ wo@@ ke later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web resear@@ ches , which used terms for the search for inde@@ cent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; p@@ est in the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ ests .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then looked at the in@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June of last year on 25 January this year , and not to appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in provis@@ ional custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad @-@ user switches to small cross @-@ border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are picked up from the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly in smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the federal police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn rural districts along the Inn &apos;s border river Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and traffic jam .
there they are received by federal police and re@@ directed to the registration .
according to federal police reports , more refugees once again met at Munich central station in comparison with the week &apos;s start .
only up to 8@@ am , some 700 people have arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the rein@@ tro@@ duction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : fo@@ oth@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area on Western Europe , warm sea air is currently in the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) announced in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the fo@@ oth@@ ill of the Tro@@ pen@@ storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
storms and storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , up to d@@ onn@@ erst@@ a@@ early also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly noticeable in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) , around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations have been ac@@ counted for this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( public days from 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel introduces entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offers diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competing VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is also visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door in a conventional and a distin@@ c@@ tly sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan er@@ un@@ er wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe will start in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n fan was especially hand @-@ positioned at the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lamps equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was especially modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the high @-@ quality Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI can be added at the I@@ AA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Te@@ gel judicial body , who was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was the decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on his free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his detention conditions were failed due to the un@@ worthy conditions of custody upon the Berlin Land .
but the Constitutional Jud@@ ges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity bre@@ ached .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of sti@@ cky days for compensation were decisive , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear to guard the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Jud@@ ges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April they said to a det@@ ain@@ ee only in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision from 2011 , it is also un@@ worthy of the multiple occup@@ ations of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ humane accommodation in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 are to be taken away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different prognos@@ es between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - and indeed the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these especially favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to be built each year and therefore the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
on the other hand , scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says immigration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour .
whereas previously there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that restri@@ cts asylum seek@@ ers to a home .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - a majority in the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of German knowledge is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the king &apos;s way of integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sty@@ bar , spokes@@ man for the youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
students without knowledge of German are prepared in the classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or dung do not receive any benefits in accordance with the application of asylum seek@@ ers if they start studying .
the latter princip@@ ally do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ing persons .
patient @-@ toler@@ ated refugees have had to live in Germany four years so far in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this gap is reduced to 15 months .
but also this gap has to be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ religions ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear partners and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to viol@@ ate such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of society in the future .
in order for the majority society to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
while Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU mur@@ derer series showed systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and what international agreements like the anti@@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany commit , must become reality over the next few years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and Cap@@ aci@@ ties , &quot; he said , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money would have to flow into the system for this .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all new@@ com@@ ers to issue health cards at the same time .
services rendered may later be b@@ illed with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; law provides .
apart from that , doctors mostly make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are becoming more informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for instance , under refugee cad@@ res there are significantly more in@@ tra@@ geous ob@@ struc@@ tions , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ education .
with the partial other illnesses German doctors are coming from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and concerning the lack of doctors , it may possibly be allevi@@ ated by the refugees .
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system and several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ghtening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have a psych@@ otherapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can make a request for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare offices , the process usually takes several months .
moreover , in the welfare offices there are mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe leads wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest leader of Africa , fell from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also critic@@ ised by the opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen .
last month they had out@@ la@@ wed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that warned them to b@@ other Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will be split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such as an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ its into a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss the next four matches for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le bones or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 League matches in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an over@@ due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will pursue a career of the kind he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and treat players who need it to break a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; Camp@@ aig@@ n &quot; was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , where 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant prospect of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never worked out in ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 proclaimed the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , vibrant and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this foc@@ us@@ sing was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but through his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the cra@@ ving of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
how an employee of telephone past@@ oral care explained to me : ... &quot; my role of listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I merge with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest on this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed cou@@ l@@ isse , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help make PSG , Malm@@ ö to rent
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria will meet at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani hit a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t finish one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team following his injury , which ended on weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stung by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who can take the PSG to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ ö defense , before he shut down to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
however , if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps p@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG was sometimes up , with some short@@ com@@ ings and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped alone in the first half by no less than five attempts alone after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shot past by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second goal at last fell shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus sc@@ ored his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was det@@ ained a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG was playing a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague which has not the same level .
qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its huge debt collection plan .
London , registered company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately USD 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights caused a spe@@ edy increase to the top of the London stock exchange .
the share sprang up 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay about a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confir@@ ming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , xis first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and replies to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders fed bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to expand American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while President Obama and President X@@ i also have the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i will address a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spy @-@ China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner , four champion Champions League winner , twice champion Champions , twice European champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now advis@@ es that he was standing before the European Championship in 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot;
&quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and this also happened to FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann received the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi declares why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; with that he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the whole distance on the lawn , switched the Red off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays down variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not with the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian confirmed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the band colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white enc@@ ephal@@ itis .
the producer of De@@ ar White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film direc@@ ting . Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against exposure to Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
t@@ witter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO KNO@@ WN that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ tain@@ ers and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement sc@@ ored a country @-@ wide effect and urged the legislature and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured unity .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; albums quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , the leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds quicker , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the big price of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten did not receive any prize money , although he first finished the course .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great degree of gra@@ tification .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by anyone , I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season and the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers sli@@ my past Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Det@@ roit Tiger .
they used to be one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers are standing at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday .
the Twin@@ s wast@@ ed a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Det@@ roit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to handle across a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Mus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Det@@ roit points three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three of us .
it was only his third successful launch in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw each game at bul@@ l@@ pen , and therefore I want to go all concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first r@@ ust since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit hit game , since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood , &quot; he said .
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the amb@@ ush at the end of the seventh core , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy went down wall , the only man with whom he was faced , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who made a Two @-@ Run escape from the right @-@ handed rider Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a double play
after Det@@ roit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings wall , wall made an R@@ BI double against the cil@@ los of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ done and sc@@ ored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed cut out S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth exit .
Det@@ roit benef@@ ited to the start of the game by a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two inner@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , he gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Mc@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with Run@@ ners in sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second one , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Twin@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , score no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three racks with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ lder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries due to a shoulder strap , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled from the list of injuries to start fighting the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the Twin@@ s will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute re@@ thinking about military options cannot take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective fores@@ ight . &quot;
four years ago it was said that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is crashing down our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement , where Germany could take up a specific number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit for next week , together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have failed to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who need protection , they also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who have no perspective of lead cannot stay in Germany either .
this view had been unanim@@ ously divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a huge effort .
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to lock the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to told Hungary that the tu@@ gs were looking for an extension to Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ ings .
this includes researchers from the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; room probe .
thus the moon turns easily around the ring planet on its path .
although this movement is only small , but still too great for a consistent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
as early as 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and therefore feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole it must give an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not clari@@ fied .

&quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a non @-@ compatible pro@@ s .

no diet fruit - man@@ go contains a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to take care of his slender line will often be rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively lots of sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it soft@@ ens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ea and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first f@@ atten@@ ing tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes &apos; Side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz communicated on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm @-@ strength through the F@@ öhn@@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the fo@@ eh@@ n .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows on Thursday morning in the F@@ ern Valley with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places up to the adjacent mid@@ range , and on the mountains even or@@ can arches of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday a stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer@@ y temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity on the alpine hill starts to sto@@ w .
here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with partly more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after the last days already huge amounts of rain have fallen .
on Thursday morning , a cold front starts with a strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind e@@ ats strong to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures drop significantly .
the following days are present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
on Wednesday , in the presence of San Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless plaz@@ a in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing ceremony was requested by the working community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es over the centuries as a minority were often only able to live their faith only in secret .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a rotten sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to histori@@ ans his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the master@@ pieces that Ot@@ mar alto painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar alto Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross travel , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
in doing so , he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into current contex@@ ts into today .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quot@@ ation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family which belonged to the stringent Protest@@ ant emper@@ or religious order .
&quot; the education has already taken place with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out that , in order to be able to bear with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of worlds of vision is shaped by advertisement today , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall into the images &quot; and let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
on Tuesday , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started his presentation of the Ot@@ mar alto bi@@ ble in the Ot@@ mar alto @-@ foundation , &quot; Al@@ ways ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I did not pay attention to completely recording the Bible , but also choosing the most important , mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ am@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn weld
plans made , company mand@@ ated , company mand@@ ated , Earth Hill model@@ ed for a circular course : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was over again .
om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured a bl@@ ur@@ ring , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
thus , hill dep@@ orted , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
permission was granted in October , but Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate with her in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further memorial break &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga stri@@ ves for a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy to help cope with upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister for State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial point must be the policy .
for this reason , the German So@@ ccer League has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will show a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen met Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their places is great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , together with the German Federal Government ( DF@@ B ) and the German federal government , the association provides 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , he was power@@ less , then pulled out to the street , which he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP da , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two pedi@@ gre@@ es Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button In@@ quiry , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
with Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback made by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally fell into pieces .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga football match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ e position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is deployed in all Europe le@@ ague games in the future , Tu@@ chel has dismis@@ sed it .
with high probability he will also deny the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl re@@ alizes : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership in Germany
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the transformation of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the I@@ AA .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band removal and rapid access to digital radi@@ ot@@ el@@ ephone .
a test track at the Highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are brushed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to apply for example internationally that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
in addition , the German government plans to adopt a change in the Vienna Convention , which previously only pre@@ views the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the In@@ test@@ ator Dek@@ ra on Wednesday conclu@@ des that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 per cent do not expect to believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 per cent of the traffic could be present on the motorway , 45 percent in the traffic jam .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to control the car .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status qu@@ ests of September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to open only in sing@@ les .
the final decision should be made by 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point in time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship appointment in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are not such a clear favourite now , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; said the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figures gru@@ es@@ ome cab@@ in@@ et : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his attitude to a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
the show is not arranged chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : in order to fres@@ hen the dol@@ ls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have check@@ ered 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different said G@@ aul@@ tier .
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , hes@@ it@@ ant , fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as G@@ aul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who worked on curtains and she@@ ers for example .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Pl@@ auen barn .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of Pl@@ auen lace fashion plays a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt proposes some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bul@@ ls , is an increasing order potential .
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already carry out half of all orders .
he is a member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener summit and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years some 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ alers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up to date to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery pearl in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ dery and lace embroi@@ dery .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small spheres at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t get on with traditional pl@@ ush . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ auen lace - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a souven@@ ir .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be stir@@ red , but Disney is nevertheless w@@ aking up to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the Entertainment Week@@ ly , however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open up wider to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should invest in attra@@ cting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regul@@ ating market access , relaxation of border control policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system .
after the statement a negative list is created which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that do not qualify for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it as@@ signs to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offering to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to increase the consumption of consumers with a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a member of the EU &apos;s working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ or fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy reduction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; low volumes can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of un@@ born injuries .
the Federal Environment Ministry explains its website with regard to the maximum values applicable , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is primarily transported through the coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations met Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide crossed , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March .
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
