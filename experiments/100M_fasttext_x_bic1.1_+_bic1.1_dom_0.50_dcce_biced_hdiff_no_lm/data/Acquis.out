&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the Part I provisions on securing measures .
the objective of the securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ eng@@ es for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a reduction by the risk of early detection .
for the purpose of sub@@ mitting the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ al with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the review by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone , the quantity of material not proven for a specific period of time is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the stated me@@ gen .
when performing their reviews , the organization makes full use of the security system of the community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following type and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are appropriate :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , shipping , lost or other way from the base material removed from the stock and the amounts of stock ;
B ) the assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system that indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) Pre@@ ferences which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material as long as it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the core fuel cycle occurs in the states , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the conditions specified in Article 11 do not comply with the requirements , the Community is temporarily not possible or desired , so the Organization and the Community shall consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided the organisation and the Community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is practically non @-@ profit .
on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under the agreement , from these security measures , provided that the total amount of core material released in the States amounts to no more than
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural urine , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with the security measures , precau@@ tions for re @-@ application of the securing measures are met on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which is required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective fulfil@@ lment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in detail how the procedures defined in the Convention apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amend@@ ments may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment to this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention into force . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements may enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the Organization , the Community and the States .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this agreement under@@ lying nuclear material in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and results of their reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need for individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EW@@ G and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ ties to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Tax Account , &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States will contribute to the Special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , and this is only the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account will be separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or interest @-@ bearing debit notes of the Member State , which are to be depos@@ ited in the currency of the respective state in order of the organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the site of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
( II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point which was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into consideration the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one member state can make payments before the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned dates if desired .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organisation , the car@@ et@@ aker suggests disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate drawing on cash or issu@@ ing in order to cover expenses for the special transactions and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit acquisition capacity on loan terms and conditions of loan ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is considered , approved and administered for the fund &apos;s loan program , irrespective of whether it is part of the fund &apos;s loan program , which is considered to be the target of the ac@@ tion@@ ality stated under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are pay@@ able at ten free @-@ years each in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this data clock must be paid directly to the organization that it re@@ tains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each special loan is to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceeds from each special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction loan at the time of the loan granted .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the bai@@ li@@ ff has instruc@@ ted the EW@@ G to complete all special forms of action through the directors approved in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the special loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special loan and the expenses made for this .
the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the fiscal year of the organisation a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account .
after full payment of the special loan loan , the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are attributable to the account recei@@ pts to be financed from the account and the amounts paid from the account and the withdraw@@ als made to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EW@@ G ( represented by the Commission of the European Commun@@ ities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the complete edition of the means of the special @-@ action account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement did not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date by the EEC and the organization , the agreement and all obligations of the parties arising there@@ from are due immediately .
if the total amount of capital invested by the recipi@@ ents in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement has been paid back and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties arising there@@ from are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Commun@@ ities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat leads these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement will be effective and will come into effect on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally binding .

already now , however , some conditions have been mentioned , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
in every stand@@ by credit , BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without being exceeded for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for the extension of the loan , BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of one month after the Stand@@ by agreement was concluded , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the BIS , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time that would be negoti@@ ated taking into account the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BIS at the time specified under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if BI@@ Z has to obtain the required resources on the market , however , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Commun@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I ad@@ ore myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for She@@ ep and Go@@ at Me@@ ums by the Commun@@ ion . in the course of these negotiations , both parties will be entered as follows :
- fresh or cooled ro@@ cket - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to the usual supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement see each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina @-@ regulated access to the joint market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .

the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ sentence of the exhaus@@ tion shall be taken into account under number 5 .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be set to 23 000 metric tons of slaughter on the Day of the Greek accession to the Community .
the community does everything in order to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within agreed quantities .
in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions , so that the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist dues on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation of the Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ - and Trade Agreement .
in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this Agreement , in particular by issu@@ ing a set of export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products listed under the number 1 .
the Community is in turn obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the gran@@ ting of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products origin@@ ates in Argentina on the basis of a export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are set in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence can be wai@@ ved for the products in question .
in the provisions stipul@@ ated , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall inform the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals , for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may possibly be de@@ cryp@@ ted to destination country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee ensures that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he regularly reviews the Ten@@ den@@ cy on the H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and Go@@ at &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the destination named No. 7 .
the committee is concerned that the proper use of this agreement will not be imp@@ aired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out according to the Community .
the Committee considers all questions arising in carrying out this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the GAT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount determined by the entry into force of this agreement between 1 January and 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and , on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes which they consider to be deemed necessary .
I would be grateful if you would give the consent of your government to this .
I encourage you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I ad@@ here to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
recogni@@ zing the fact that the sheep economy and exports of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat are not affected in these markets , I urge myself to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure the access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
new Zealand is given the assurance that the normal sales of its H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the set @-@ up amount did not exceed the determined amount of the year .
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in the traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community re@@ affir@@ ms that New Zealand should not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community market .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contracting parties shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in Kl@@ ause 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amounts , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of products collected from this agreement to a set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when new Member States are joined , the Community in Consult@@ ation with New Zealand changes the quantities stipul@@ ated in cl@@ ause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ sentence of the Extra@@ ction mentioned in Kl@@ ause 5 is taken into account .
the total amount mentioned in Kl@@ ause 2 is set to 245 500 tons of slaughter with the day of the Greek accession to the community .
the community does everything in order to avoid market development that could affect the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within agreed quantities .
in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions , so that the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist dues of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of this objective .
in addition , the two parties to the contract undertake anything to promote consumption of meat in the community without danger to market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand warran@@ ts adher@@ ence to the quantities mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in a special way that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the Community is in turn obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the gran@@ ting of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products will be subject to the origin in New Zealand upon the submission of a export license issued by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are set in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence can be wai@@ ved for the products in question .
in terms of implementing provisions , it is further stipul@@ ated that the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community in the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informs the quantities that export lic@@ ences have been granted ; these data may possibly be de@@ cryp@@ ted to destination country .

the committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of significance for the target named in Kl@@ ause 7 .
the committee is concerned that the proper application of the agreement is not imp@@ aired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out according to the community under the agreement .
the committee will discuss all the issues arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the Parties in the context of the GAT@@ T .
the annual amount determined in cl@@ ause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of this volume , which is valid from the entry into force of the following year , is determined in relation to the total annual amount .

reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen contained in the antibody or other substance specified on the label homo@@ olo@@ g .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manner suggested by the producer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent to be studied on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood @-@ body @-@ liqui@@ dation in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the determination of blood group determination , and for the reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for the blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the th@@ inner of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series where a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tration of the unknown reag@@ ent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 International units per ml according to the definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative ti@@ ration of the International Standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required characteristics shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent in a liquid form according to the label is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the ex@@ piration date for dry reag@@ ents on the label is determined according to the results of the ex@@ piration attempts ; it is to be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry reaction may not only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ents delivered with the dry reag@@ ents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ sol@@ dered ser@@ um .
reag@@ ents , regardless of whether in a liquid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the reag@@ ents destined for international exchange for blood group determination should preferably not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least as long as an international Convention on a uniform system has come about .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that the reag@@ ent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity of data in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the production laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of reag@@ ents for blood group appointment .
adequate samples of all reag@@ ents entered are so long to be preserved from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
reag@@ ents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the efficacy and maintain the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
a black and white printed label in English and French can be attached to each container , containing the following information : 1 . the name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the cases related to the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper , for which preliminary prints are to be used in Anne@@ x I to this Convention .
depending on the case , the standard paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation .
- to carry out legal rules in force in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed if the sole use of a single @-@ party paper ;
- to be required by those involved so that they may apply for the benefit of an advantage or a certain relief .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will fulfil this desire as far as possible .
