<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need for individual countries with low incomes whose development is impeded by general ressourcentransferproblems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EWG and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid-ties to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>

<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The bailiff has instructed the EWG to complete all special forms of action through the directors approved in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the special loan, the caretaker will inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>

<seg id="1469">Anti-Rh blood type sera each specifity can belong to one of two species, which differ by the conditions under which an agglutination of homologous blood cells is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1470">With others, which are referred to as "incompletely," an agglutination can only be achieved in the presence of certain colloids such as cattle albumin or with the help of other special methods.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Some "incomplete" Sera agglutinate on object carriers also homologous red blood cells that are washed up in their own serum or plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The following requirements on the effectiveness of Sera for determining the Rh group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available. i) Anti-D (Anti-Rho) Blood typserum (human)</seg>

<seg id="1477">In addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the tigen D, the serum should react with blood cells that contain do-antigen.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Anti-D Sera, which are intended for the use of object carriers according to the Diamond and Abelson properties, must have a visible agglutination in 30 seconds with a similar amount of 40 to 50 per cent of ccDee blood cells, and agglutination must be complete within 120 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reacts with floods of human red blood cells that contain the antigen C, but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C antigen.</seg>
<seg id="1481">These Sera are therefore only specific for the C antigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.9per cent of saline solution.</seg>
