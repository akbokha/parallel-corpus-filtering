this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder whereby the patients have various epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and for the prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
both diseases can be used to treat or use the melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are min@@ ed just like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of neur@@ ons among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to take .
in both studies with the injection solution patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than those receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were equally effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled nerv@@ ousness ) , trem@@ ors ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , aut@@ op@@ p@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and mild to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared with the risks .
moreover , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission was approved by the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for placing A@@ bili@@ fy on the market in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , they should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relation between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar management due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while c@@ max remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in the combined use of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
if one considers the joint application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying treatment .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of the lack of data to ensure safety in humans and because of the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animals , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned to operate dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them .
the following adverse events were higher ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ma@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to those treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients taking O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under@@ went hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under@@ went Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under@@ went Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose occurrence has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without fat@@ alities .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ pi@@ tor .
when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day for healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a plac@@ ebo @-@ superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a retention effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ale is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of moderate @-@ state @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bil@@ e monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human bil@@ e at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the batch of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of 3- and 11 @-@ times the medium @-@ sized Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets may alternatively use the melt tablets to acquire ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .

A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ jection Solution is used to quickly control the det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under enclosure of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drugs applied already for conservation or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to acquire ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under@@ went Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under@@ went Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose occurrence has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) of 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline in the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression @-@ rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % higher than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time was 1 to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level was reached .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 @-@ times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which 1 to 3 @-@ times the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer show that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood , or before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that dru@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it was not necessary to be given other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the sale of Abra@@ x@@ ane to the European Union to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed to receive first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy counts &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients suffering from impair@@ ment of kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and treated with sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el once more .
in the patients , no renewed abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phy has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
while a cor@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to abrasion has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic agents and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable treatment method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
men who are treated with ab@@ ab@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child will testify .
male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment , as the treatment with ab@@ ab@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ re@@ dness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ab@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the donation of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate levels in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burns , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pains , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there has been no caus@@ al relationship with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the co@@ ag@@ ulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular India and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ meri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( edi@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of det@@ erg@@ ents for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and of 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparison study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with ab@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre @-@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had an adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or tissue integration of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute In@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metabol@@ ised primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , there are only few data available about patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and , as well as other potentially toxic substances , should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane precau@@ tion .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the pier@@ cing bottle should be slowly and carefully turned and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete resin board of the powder is performed .
if variations or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ ability prior to application .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing on the market before the market launch supplies medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contribution . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product acci@@ dental cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ fer@@ rous values in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if an own blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body is not sufficiently respon@@ sive to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia associated with the refer@@ ral drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they either were ren@@ amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of fl@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients being converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which may occasionally cause symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine headache and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union directives , Ab@@ se@@ amed has shown that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed to the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance cans than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance cans than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permitted dose needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl per week , the dose should be 150 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the regeneration rate of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves is required , should receive am@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ sec@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula pin , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ i ) .
patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial closure , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ ds or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden weight loss , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the reproductive cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is decreased ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( ren@@ al an@@ emia patients ) are not sufficient .
8 Pati@@ ents with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the ability of epo@@ e@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased through the concentration needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms and preventing blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in intensity should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ dently cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to current knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients that may have to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to reduce the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 for the treatment of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs begin .
patients under@@ going major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in the case of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may be associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumour tissue , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ as@@ tis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men , retin@@ alis ) , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ dos@@ ed and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality rate than in the controls due to a number of common mal@@ ign@@ omas .
overall survival in the studies was not explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after IV injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism or unknown factors .

the owner agre@@ es to apply the studies and additional measures to the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance described in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) mentioned in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and according to each subsequent risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management System for the Products for human use &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) • by promp@@ ting E@@ MEA
• In a month prior to your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • If you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , an abnormal blood drop occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial closure ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ c@@ asses ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which is rep@@ atri@@ ated during further treatment .
your doctor may conduct regular check@@ ups to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated before the beginning of the therapy with ab@@ sec@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ st after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( skin @-@ inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ sec@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , den@@ amed by injec@@ ting must be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney ail@@ ments and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to current knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney ail@@ ments ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) values and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minim@@ ise the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed work as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor .
if a major orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery is required , before the start of the treatment , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment .
if your blood color@@ ant values ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ rop@@ phy after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly order certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may order regular blood tests to check the outcome of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of ab@@ sec@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large injec@@ tions .
your doctor may order regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic ha@@ hip as in case of infection ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta , the symptoms that arise in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache , can be reduced .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ 0,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was examined .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate content in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks the bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( excluding oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bon@@ ded acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
A@@ cl@@ asta manufactures recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance materials for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the placing of A@@ cl@@ asta in the European Union .

the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for treating post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) If patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents under 18 years of age are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with A@@ cl@@ asta prior to treatment with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available for patients requiring dental intervention , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected adverse events reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney dysfunction has been associated with kidney dysfunction , which has been linked to kidney function ( i.e. an increase of ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the patient &apos;s disease pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently reported hip fra@@ cture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as re@@ dness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area was generally reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including chel@@ id@@ onic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 Study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area in a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing tor@@ ed@@ al body fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta posted an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta improved bone density at lum@@ bar lin@@ ol@@ eic acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hips by 6.0 % , the she@@ ar neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of oste@@ opor@@ osis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in comparison to plac@@ ebo an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5@@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ) and 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta therapy in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment BM@@ D on the total th@@ ump and sh@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta therapy resulted in more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and by 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show fewer clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in patients and patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy morph@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone was investigated ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when included in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 m@@ g. of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decline in pain intensity and pain influence compared to bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed after 6 months .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the 6 month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients participating in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life @-@ times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale elimination speed of ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a decreased clear@@ ance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely , because it is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , compound @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ onic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clearance , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ onic acid .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) has only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C have 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was determined by administ@@ ering doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to twice the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in ra@@ bb@@ its , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low ser@@ um calcium level .

according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current information on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ onic acid is a substance of a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made up of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured in@@ subordin@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus again gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and drink , be sure to take sufficient liquid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to administ@@ er A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ asta is effective for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta may take longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the end of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta If you consider the termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ fusion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent inf@@ usions , however , are less common .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
at present it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in you after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta .

reported on allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this product information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , it is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fra@@ cture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta the patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the fast inser@@ tion of the effect of bon@@ ded ol@@ eic acid on bone reconstruction a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , ongoing , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice a day 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent for setting smoking in comparison to a plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia identified during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts to a small minority of patients .
caution is advised on simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drug against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ ate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , which makes it easier to adjust type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered .
at the end of the trial therapy , the effect of the addition of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea resulted in lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the addition of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high k@@ et@@ one mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the acquisition of Ac@@ tos in the European Union to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited company .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and with which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for using pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) to develop a compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular ou@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and prev@@ ent@@ ative advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was carried out .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , but this did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the laboratory parameters are pre@@ clu@@ ded by clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be ag@@ itated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ c and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple @-@ combination therapy with an insulin or dual combination therapy with insulin can reduce the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market introduction , a decrease in visual acu@@ ity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated Fra@@ ktur @-@ incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not in@@ valuable from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic active substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T ass@@ ump@@ tions above three times the upper limit of the normal range were common to plac@@ ebo , but less common than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures in random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occ@@ ured .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study conducted at 18 weeks of type 2 diab@@ etics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed dimin@@ ished values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively mark@@ eted pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium was induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ one led to increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur @-@ incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in another study over two years , the effects of a met@@ form@@ in combination therapy with each pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in output values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both about an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the goal of their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as is unable to produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to a other human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to in@@ mim@@ ic ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packing supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risk of treating diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a fast initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has , for example , improved significantly by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change .
some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients on the drugs taken by them .
4 As well as hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in an un@@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ er@@ als Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with dis@@ comfort which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .

diseases of the skin and the sub@@ skin tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection site , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise if failed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
general illnesses and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( re@@ dness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
disorders of the immune system occasionally - ur@@ tic@@ aria , ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ainting / un@@ consciousness .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can evolve gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods .
diab@@ etics should always have grape sugar@@ s , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) is treated by a reported help or glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the work is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human ins@@ ul@@ ine molec@@ ule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must be raised , followed by the amount of insulin acting .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change .
before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. bigger urine deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the level of ur@@ ic acid levels after two to four weeks is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there may still be g@@ ossi@@ p attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ o@@ virus at least take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ o@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily intake 120 mg , had an ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
this was compared to 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the current or current rheum@@ atic ties and / or g@@ g@@ arthritis ) .
if the level of ser@@ um acid levels is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there is no experience in children and adolescents , it is not recommended to use F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ saw @-@ producing medicines , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment phase because the lowering of the ser@@ um acid standard can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ec@@ tomy and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was no interaction studies carried out at F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposition ( c@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the other used other active ingredient is required .
in a study with subjects 120 mg of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in c@@ max by 32 % , however , does not cause a significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not close to the side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ gruppe in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 vs. 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related during long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all cases of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment group more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ kre@@ ate in@@ in@@ wert to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um@@ cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for the analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering of the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ ina in@@ in@@ oids &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( ie .
with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , not@@ with@@ standing their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um acid levels resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. over 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gir@@ th , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the top marks up to the month of 24 .
elevated T@@ SH@@ s values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( c@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional rate .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the c@@ max amounts to approx . 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ east@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 liters , taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after intake of an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
besides ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found in the chair as un@@ modified fat ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the c@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at took about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver Dys@@ function , the c@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , depression of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , at about 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the performance rate and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying ra@@ bb@@ its with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , showed no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP is to present risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA
in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by 1 x daily intake of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms is achieved .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart defect or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated as a result of a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a canc@@ er@@ ous disease or the les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) is treated .
if at the moment you have a g@@ out attack ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , re@@ dness , warmth and swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cl@@ utter@@ ed before starting treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months if you are taking A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you use / apply your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use any of the following substances as interactions with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may occur . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of cancer ) • Az@@ ath@@ i@@ op@@ rine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma in case of heart disease )
no studies on the effects of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC have been carried out on road safety and the ability to operate machinery .
therefore , please take A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from an in@@ compatibility to certain sugar@@ s .
the individual week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster pack so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .
if you have un@@ inten@@ tionally over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital .
if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , take it as soon as possible unless the next intake is short .
when you stop taking A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can increase again , and your complaints can wor@@ sen because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kid@@ neys as well as their surroundings .
frequent side effects ( more than 1 out of 100 treatment , but less than 1 out of 10 treatment ) : • Collec@@ tible liver test results • diar@@ rhe@@ a • head@@ aches • rash • nausea

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are fragile ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ cer@@ a ( swal@@ lowing ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sour upset .
in patients with any kind of hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it may not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side @-@ effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day of the day . • Pati@@ ents should not che@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , be given only with particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , like o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by R@@ ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to remedy symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ ale pain or new or wor@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an ast@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available that will give indications whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring di@@ b@@ ular surgical intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning at the failure to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as planned for the scheduled weekday .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may interfere with the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis .
however , removal of ser@@ um calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholesterol to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in lower strength ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or Fos@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 332 ) ; other vitamin D supplements were forbidden .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the average ser@@ um levels of 25 hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 12 % vs .
studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equ@@ ability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 m@@ g. a day ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and fra@@ cture intervention study ( F@@ IT : N = 6,@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
in the phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years , 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the stimulation of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new fluid fra@@ cture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ ate on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before reception of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in average of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily divided into soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
after IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , about 50 % of the substance selected was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
after IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance process exceeded 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems in humans .

adv@@ agra@@ m is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer already are used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereas the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by exam@@ ining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ ph cannot be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the same drug may need to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in wording or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be checked before change@@ over time and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 systemic exposure measured as valley level , with both form@@ ulations , was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ kers are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ gra@@ fting phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral treatment in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained during the application to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily administration in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily administration in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Con@@ version from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to occur in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection has to commen@@ ce .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily .
other transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph in lung , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ t patients , received a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular appointment of ser@@ um cancer , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ lays and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph Dur@@ ing the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations regarding the valley level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case taking the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ ular controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ king levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in simultaneous use of substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the bas@@ al level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in wording or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents and gra@@ ft recipi@@ ents in childhood , no clinical data are available for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other remedies during a treatment with an@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) can be avoided due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Progra@@ f an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ rup@@ tions are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted because of the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contain hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is required .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels at the same time as substances that can change C@@ YP@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when taking decisions about receiving contrac@@ eption .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born to possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in desc@@ ending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor .
12 confirmed evacu@@ ations amounted to 32.@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 237 ) 32.@@ 6 % and in the Progra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

overall , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies reported the observations in the large studies where Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents .
lung transplan@@ tation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral Progra@@ f was reported by 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in cases treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21,@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans was compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ rolled by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the occurrence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ as Transplan@@ tation A multic@@ enter study with oral Progra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who were simultaneously treated to a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t who received tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) after a random@@ ised trial .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral Progra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after bow@@ el transplan@@ ts showed a survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ tic value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through the bil@@ e .
in stable patients who were converted from Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ rup@@ tions are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables it to form the human scent factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new an@@ emia epis@@ odes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , the place and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
during the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injec@@ tions .
in their reaction to Factor VIII , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. should be given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the administration speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII &apos;s Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 days of exposure is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed for a different re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there is no experience about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of whom were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ level was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th day of the postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed low inhibit@@ ors with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients treated inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by exam@@ ining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side @-@ effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that pointed to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII acts as a counter@@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

special caution when applying A@@ DV@@ ATE is required you should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with factor VIII products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms may include early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic shock which can include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
please tell your doctor if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
your doctor will charge your dose of A@@ DV@@ ATE ( in international units or I.@@ U. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .
patients who develop factor VIII inhibit@@ ors If the expected factor VIII levels in your plasma cannot be achieved with A@@ DV@@ ATE or the bleeding cannot be controlled , this might be due to the development of factor VI@@ II@@ -
in conjunction with surgery cath@@ eter infections , lower number of red blood cells , swelling of limbs and joints , prolonged bleeding after drainage , decreased factor VIII @-@ levels and postoperative hem@@ at@@ omas .
rare side effects Sin@@ ce the introduction of the drug on the market has been occasionally reported on severe and potentially life @-@ threatening reactions ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ) and other allergic reactions ( see above ) .

based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates the submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissues that connects , surro@@ unds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself , thus preventing infection in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of sub@@ structure , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents , CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ec@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know CH@@ MP to see whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years or older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be tra@@ pped to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main impacts were the changes in sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the trial the patients en@@ rolled their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose the patients who took aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patients who took P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane was observed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) or ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( cereb@@ ral stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe permission to transfer Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to last as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since during long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cts such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be used either or@@ ally or nas@@ ally as a swelling conventional Rhin@@ olog@@ ic@@ um ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be dis@@ continued .
patients suffering from cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the mat@@ ological tests are carried out because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with a plac@@ ebo and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin not in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency with the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin re@@ dness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion @-@ inhibit@@ or P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration was administered .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dos@@ cope study , which was carried out as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were badly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( c@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was to the exposure of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ atal / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in ra@@ bb@@ its in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine very rarely was reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , sei@@ zur@@ es , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver locations has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup res@@ p .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gles , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the 2 @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US led to an average decrease of the symptom score ( symptom rating ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline in symptom relief after six weeks of treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo treated patients .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe permission to market A@@ ER@@ I@@ US throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms end and res@@ ume when re @-@ occ@@ uring .
for persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to light , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ re@@ dness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion @-@ inhibit@@ or P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study of multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in a single dose study with adult des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown by the total scores of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ with@@ standing the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ arian diseases , it is expected that , besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study where patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not depend on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .

A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis are caused by an infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher compound load ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily deser@@ ting dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the n@@ ine@@ x of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect an increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets did not influence psych@@ omot@@ or in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was not an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the total scores of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restri@@ ctive met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater than black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study involving sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which can be fully met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the stress ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the c@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that the C and c@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to the recommended doses of pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup is offered in type III bracelet bottles with child proof poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging them .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical study of multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet must be removed without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg in@@ fusion tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age has not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ate for losing wor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad .

in single dose Cros@@ sover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablet with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ compatible .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in conjunction with the dose of dose studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children between 6 and 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported in plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was observed to avoid any side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 .
the recommended doses were the Plas@@ ma@@ concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see under Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect an increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis may , depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and
as shown by the total scores of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the spread of this restri@@ ctive met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater than black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ ER@@ I@@ US solution for taking the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine contains , no bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies , the C and c@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to the recommended doses of pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus this ancest@@ or .
subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that identi@@ fies the human body as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ per@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor checks which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not to cure , however , can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this was compared to other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very limited to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a greater loss of viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are min@@ ed as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee established that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally supposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to grant approval for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic padding of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r should take place using the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( padding ) , higher doses of ag@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children .
as@@ per@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ per@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during the use of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of the reduced plasma level of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
regeneration should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases in which medicines were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders , associated .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ences , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width a@@ generation cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in attempting to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ ral mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased , while c@@ max increases by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and calcium can not be given , however it is recommended to monitor closely , since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ er@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ ren@@ z ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors would be low .
Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin &apos;s effect on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is required as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of re@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg fos@@ sil@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a daily lead to increasing the c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions between sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of regeneration with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as am@@ generation .
as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , am@@ per@@ ase should not be used in combination with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am or@@ ally recorded ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advised .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ asing inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r along with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the slight neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to be adjusted when amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous am@@ generation ( see section 4.4 ) .
during the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of breast @-@ feeding amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished growth of 12 body weight during feeding .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the drop in treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another in the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg am@@ o@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ation and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fibro@@ us sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients had 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary to initiate necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently permitted fossi@@ ls R@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ in@@ inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely were observed .
in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ ossi@@ r avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors not previously treated , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing based analysis gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the implications regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret performance test results .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with a fossil @-@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can be det@@ ri@@ mental to subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study where PI treated with PI for vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI Group in comparison to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ jection threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ br@@ anded am@@ per@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 B@@ ased on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation studies with PI previously treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ob@@ st@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , however , for c@@ max decrease by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of c@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be minor on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these chem@@ otherap@@ ies lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals with dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ ome aber@@ ration test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If ag@@ er@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( padding ) , higher doses of ag@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
regeneration should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , while c@@ max increases by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and calcium can not be given , however it is recommended to monitor closely , since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors would be low .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available for this .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
in a clinical trial where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of breast @-@ feeding amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary to initiate necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration when using PI previously treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of c@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals with dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to human beings after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature in young , so that amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase can be used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
the benefit of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; blo@@ o@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was neither used in patients with PI previously untreated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given to the simultaneous use of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
regeneration should be reli@@ eved in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , while c@@ max increases by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to take into account may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propeller engl@@ y@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of breast @-@ feeding amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another in the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of underlying disease .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed to the affected areas of the skin , so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • Results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread is to continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces disappear in the gen@@ itals or per@@ c area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if at follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ed the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then proce@@ eded with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully incorporated .

in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a tendency to circumc@@ ision were observed .
in the case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency treatment and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been carried out for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied remedies for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ c area .
although limited data points to an increased rate of incident reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown in this group of patients with regard to eradi@@ c@@ ating the genital war@@ ts , however , less effectiveness .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair approach has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) have a lower chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ ev@@ rot .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect , were in these studies a response to the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical studies of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , it often results in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ aps / scales ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread was very common to severe ery@@ them@@ ic subjects ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and c@@ arm@@ ament ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials evaluating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
in 60 % of patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
total healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :

the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with mol@@ lus@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks )
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were lying 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four month study for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat rat concentrations , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with ren@@ al or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alising facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment , there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged period of inter@@ ruption .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ise the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
the side effects in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase III study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are performed in the following table as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing apparatus and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe course form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a severe form of ser@@ o@@ con@@ version in patients aged 5 and older ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , including 3 patients with no ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with insufficient to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 and one in phase 2 ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the treatment of the enzyme lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzy@@ matic activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes from cells , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients had the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and the ability to pay , which is shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study showed normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ level in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variables ( expected percentage @-@ normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the middle course of course ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental rate of development after the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental rate of development , whereas in the older patients with severe form of course there was limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosage regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ level in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 and older was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with a single dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be seen as a particular haz@@ ard to humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6 . 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in pier@@ cing bottle ( type I @-@ glass ) with stop@@ pers ( silicone chlor@@ ob@@ but@@ yl rubber ) and sealing ( aluminum ) with tear cap ( poly@@ propylene ) .
10 Prepar@@ ation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of pier@@ cing bottles to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of the individual patient .
within the given period , the owner of the marketing authority has to complete the following programme of study , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term security and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you use pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of reduced al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
indication of handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ induced involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing apparatus and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ reaction to the in@@ fusion point
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of pier@@ cing bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medication against vom@@ iting ) and fluids should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) .
in patients whose blood aspect changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , set off or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer duration of life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 45@@ 6 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transfer of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each loop has to be dis@@ sol@@ dered with 4.@@ 2@@ ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with low @-@ rate advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , except for predomin@@ ant plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA is 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pill re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third operation cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood image should be created before every application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dose test must take place under consideration - correction of the adi@@ rs of the blood count or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are according to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Deg@@ ree 2 bleeding .
patients should not develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity is 3 or 4 or so on when grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity occurs .
clinical studies have no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients who are 65 years old or older than 65 years of age .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dosage adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ binary limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of abnormal liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ lic number returns a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instruc@@ ted to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients en@@ vis@@ aged for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion before the em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredient .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damaging of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed exists , men should be advised before the treatment regim@@ en to seek advice regarding semen retention .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in decreased ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution should therefore be taken if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with decent an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy except when it is essential and me@@ tic@@ ulous atten@@ u@@ ation of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed exists , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to seek advice regarding the sperm retention .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency indication : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontan@@ ei@@ ty ) .
* Per@@ taining to National Cancer Institute &apos;s C@@ TC version 2 for any toxic@@ ity degree excluded the event &quot; Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &quot; * * which was deduc@@ ed from the term &quot; kid@@ neys / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Reg@@ arding National Cancer Institute &apos;s C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , taste disorder and hair loss should only be reported as degrees 1 or 2 .
for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report@@ edly physician considered a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed received ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported at &gt; 5 % of 265 patients who were random@@ ized to receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed as mon@@ otherapy with the benefit of fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 , as well as 27@@ 6 patients who random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as mon@@ otherapy .
* Reg@@ arding National Cancer Institute &apos;s C@@ TC version 2 for any toxic@@ ity degree . * * Reg@@ arding National Cancer Institute &apos;s C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , hair loss should only be reported as degrees 1 or 2 .
for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report@@ edly physician considered a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed included su@@ pra@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .

these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medi@@ ation ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with N@@ SC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed and 830 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received treatment in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural eff@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the treatment of the Lun@@ che@@ gen@@ kre@@ bs@@ sympt@@ om@@ sk@@ ala in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tion arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy demonstrated a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology to the overall survival fell to the benefit of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the IT@@ T population analyses and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the P@@ Q c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

dissolve the contents of the 500 mg tanks with 20 ml of sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that feed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair speed , chair cane , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , passage of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( threads ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to grant approval for the placing of or@@ li@@ stat GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and young people under 18 , since there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ li@@ stat is only minim@@ ally absorbed , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who have a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic drug may need to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ tion in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ li@@ stat and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
for most patients who were treated with or@@ li@@ stat in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the application of an A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on one @-@ off dose , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ li@@ stat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects identified after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ing properties of or@@ li@@ stat can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ as .
from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times a day , was taken to block the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional con@@ lu@@ tions ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start the first capsule collection with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
nutritional supplements are effective as you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
in order to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• E@@ at low fat to reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .

the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ inning already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood of seeing you exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take each meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ it , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with these accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after ex@@ piration date . • Do not store the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) with which this pack is included .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speaking with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories available for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional deficiency symptoms .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0.5 kg a week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 kcal daily by exercise , e.g. by 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep it . • Sen@@ su@@ al is a food diary with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ orie and fat steps and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate release for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adult patients who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong stimul@@ i for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate stimul@@ i for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a licence for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ - interval prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not used in the days following chemotherapy , neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit the activity of the five currently investigated chemotherapy ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral meth@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies the most common adverse events were reported in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients in total ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with c@@ c@@ cy@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. or 750 micro@@ grams pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) , given intraven@@ ously at Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron who were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of the studies carried out with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
purpose of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of retin@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally in the overall dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
after IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations it emerges that at once daily IV administration of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after a single IV administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the c@@ max was higher after one @-@ time injection of 0.75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination following an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous visual injection in healthy patients the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function disorder have increased the termin@@ ale elimination and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies , indications have shown that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channel , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the potential for action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since al@@ op@@ xi is intended for a unique application in humans , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans .
the controller must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the medicine approved within the scope of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommen@@ ding the failure to appro@@ ve the use of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal properties that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a microsc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data suggest@@ ing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / /
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted does not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ated in more patients than in the reference medicinal product ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infections associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected las@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infection .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thus in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
when treating in@@ infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go have out@@ weigh@@ ed the following super@@ ficial skin infections in case of short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . , a marketing authorization for Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infections , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans for top@@ ical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle retin@@ ob@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % res@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased to reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on impact on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ob@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / completed or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman is to be considered .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the place of performance that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of retin@@ ob@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , on the basis of the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some types of infection may seem question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts .
no differences were detected in the in vitro activity of retin@@ opathy to S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S , the presence of stra@@ ins should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % res@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % res@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary un@@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 cm2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( c@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng @-@ h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , as well as in rats micro@@ nucle@@ us for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
neither male nor female rats showed signs of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 s@@ me@@ ar skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were found at oral doses ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( equal to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the authorisation application , will be present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product is mark@@ eted .

as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for the Products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodi@@ c Safety Update Report .
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you to quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless specifically prescribed by your doctor .
it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on lips , in the nose or in the female genital area .
if the o@@ int@@ ment turns into one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur .
after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area .
it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cover , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment .
it is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years of age , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be brought to an end .
if a sei@@ z@@ ure dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ ence or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the twin @-@ rix adult approved since 1996 and the twin @-@ rix children approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same illnesses , however , twin rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the use of twin rix adult were also used as a receipt for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient climate protection was similar to a six and a 12 month interval between injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ ent ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) include headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , re@@ dness , mat@@ ri@@ dity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals , a. a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ ent on the market
the standar@@ dis@@ ation plan for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ ent consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if an ino@@ cul@@ ation vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination may need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which includes 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibody levels , so that in these cases the administration of additional doses may be necessary .
because intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination in the but@@ to@@ cks , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix may be administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ ent was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eric , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , re@@ dness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ dity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thi@@ om@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ ent was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination weight .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of Ambi@@ ent , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
after the gift of Ambi@@ ance , pain was observed at 5@@ 0,7 % of the test subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % of the test subjects after the injection of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the test subjects who had given Ambi@@ ent had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ mon@@ y was compar@@ ably high per test band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the test subjects who received Ambi@@ ance compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the test subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of a combination of a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ ent or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted with vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , at the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ent and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was usable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received the vacc@@ ines either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with an Ambi@@ ent or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme using a combination of 360 @-@ ELISA units with a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies was detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ ent in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies is comparable in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme for the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ ent was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eric , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates such as previous formulation .
the vaccine must be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ p@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
in accordance with article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ owned batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ence cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the two vaccine doses have already been administered ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has / has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ent .
instead , he / your child will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ atri@@ um is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medications ( including those you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / has received / or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ ence , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ ent is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ ent pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ ent Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data that has become known since the first approval of the market , the CH@@ MP considers that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ent remains positive .
however , since ambi@@ rix was only placed in traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient expos@@ ures .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in pre@@ history in patients aged over a month with in@@ completely enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
Ammon@@ ia is - split by several individual cans to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esh@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without an active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle would effectively prevent too high ammon@@ ia levels .
ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzy@@ matic deficiency has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein toler@@ ant and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
am@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of op@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as associated clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat via the liver and kid@@ neys are performed , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be used with extreme caution .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal increase was slo@@ wed and increased neur@@ ons increased .
a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth were also found .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ etic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ ar@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose followed a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which in intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active chem@@ ically active compound con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infected , and the disease itself led to death even when treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delayed manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ carb@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ian enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual release as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20@@ g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after the intake .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20@@ g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma at night after a large majority of patients with urine @-@ cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no concl@@ usive effects with toxic and non toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esh@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al secre@@ tion .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain bar@@ k .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ etic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ ar@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , it can be assumed that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced for each gram .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
according to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after the intake .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS because the drug may go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , distur@@ ban@@ ces , loss of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed .
if you find one of these symptoms in your case , contact your doctor immediately or in the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating the appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood circulation ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
you may not use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS any longer after the exp@@ iry date on the shipping box and the container after &quot; us@@ eable until the &quot; exp@@ iry date . &quot;
like AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , and content of the package AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; u@@ cy 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a Mag@@ en@@ fi@@ stel ( hose that proceeds through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardiac attack ) without &quot; stem lift &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ ox@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of an@@ ox@@ ox in every single application or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans and a G@@ PI was compared .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ let or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart disease .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angi@@ ograms in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency interventions or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if there is a PCI in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
a bol@@ us dose of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ograms in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cap@@ tive of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ administration from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted product should be carefully mixed before the application and the stu@@ b dose is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the dose dose of 1.75 mg / kg is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which require a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din for AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , it is recommended to administ@@ er a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and re@@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ bolt was administered without a dose adjustment at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ograms can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Un@@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against mil@@ let • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial En@@ do@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
although most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur in principle throughout the treatment of bleeding .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din reflects the prior treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly in any case .
the experimental studies are inadequate in terms of impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less common among bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ at@@ oma of ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed retinal loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial involving a bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as in the compar@@ ative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is close mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din had no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the case of patients following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ ge attack ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G alter@@ ations or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ rated within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for the patients who received asp@@ ir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients under@@ going one PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ogen@@ esis in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients under@@ going per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can &apos;t work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is very slightly different from the insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes where the body &apos;s insulin is in@@ effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin lis@@ ions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.30 % of human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the abdom@@ en area .
due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change of the effect strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement .
3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the date of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin used and can therefore be changed when the treatment scheme is switched off .
the substances which increase blood sugar @-@ reducing activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic agents , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympathy like beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c immune regulation can be atten@@ u@@ ated or missing .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into the human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral use .
listed below are listed in clinical trials listed un@@ desirable drug treatments , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If it fails to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a suit@@ ably trained person or treated by a doctor by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose .
after a glu@@ ac@@ on injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a dose of proportion@@ ate glucose in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ reducing effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a double the fast effect of acting like normal insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control like in a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 Min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
