<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental disorder whereby the patients have various episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can be used to treat or use the melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are mined just like Abilify, the dose should be adapted to Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of neurons among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing her recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours compared to a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to take.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to prevent recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were equally effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled nervousness), tremors (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting, nausea, autoppation (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and mild to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission was approved by the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing Abilify on the market in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with aripiprazole in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify are signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, they should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relation between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar management due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist famotine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor ") metabolites can result in the combined use of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying treatment.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole a day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylmorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the lack of data to ensure safety in humans and because of the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animals, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits unequivocally justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned to operate dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were higher (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Maisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients taking Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients underwent haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients underwent Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients underwent Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and whose occurrence has also been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute doses with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without fatalities.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1Recipitor.</seg>
<seg id="76">When using Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg. a day for healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, nucleus caudatus and putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder respondents who adhered to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo-superior effect in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a retention effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially were not based on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effect in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination of Eliminationshale is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of moderate-state-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites in the bile monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or between 16- and 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of hydroxy- aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the batch of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to exposures of 3- and 11-times the medium-sized Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify Injection Solution is used to quickly control the detachment and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, treatment with Aripiprazol should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection in the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under enclosure of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the drugs applied already for conservation or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazol, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to acquire abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, the patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar management due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was higher compared to that after the sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as one-time indication intramuscular and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist famotine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor ") metabolites can result in the combined use of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteasinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying treatment.</seg>

<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients underwent Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients underwent Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and whose occurrence has also been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant major improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) of 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline in the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggidity, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder respondents who adhered to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression-rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially were not based on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effect in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, followed by a 74-week study extension for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% higher than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time was 1 to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level was reached.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra muscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10-times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters had previously received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as a monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane patients responded to the treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer show that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood, or before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that druxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, it was not necessary to be given other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>

<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, which do not practice an effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable treatment method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Men who are treated with ababane are advised, during and up to six months after the treatment, no child will testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment, as the treatment with ababane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 ababane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the donation of Abraxane as monotherapy at every dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate levels in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burns, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pains, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there has been no causal relationship with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules that promotes the coagulation of microtubules from the tubular India and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the cytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the albuminous protein SPARC (edited protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of detergents for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unlinked studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with abxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with pre-medication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% only had an adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% due to metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or tissue integration of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute Infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane injection (43%) and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, there are only few data available about patients at the age of 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as well as other potentially toxic substances, should be observed when dealing with Abraxane precaution.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into a Abraxane piercing bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the piercing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the piercing bottle should be slowly and carefully turned and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete resin board of the powder is performed.</seg>
<seg id="329">If variations or sinks are visible, the piercing bottle must be inverted again gently in order to achieve complete resusability prior to application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging contribution. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product accidental cooling boxes for transport through the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-ferrous values in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if an own blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body is not sufficiently responsive to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein as part of a major study of 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused anaemia associated with the referral drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they either were renamed to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of flamed Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients being converted to abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which may occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, according to the European Union directives, Abseamed has shown that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the marketing of Abseamed to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permitted dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance cans than patients where initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance cans than patients where initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permitted dose needed to control the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl per week, the dose should be 150 I.E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the regeneration rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required, should receive amamed in a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the absecamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given over the tube of a fistula pin, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients diagnosed with any erythropoetin in erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboemboli).</seg>
<seg id="409">Patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial closure, vascular disease of the carotids or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastompenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden weight loss, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reproductive cyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-response (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticuloyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is decreased (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytes and leukocytes should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (renal anemia patients) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 Patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the ability of epoeins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased through the concentration needed to control the anemia symptoms and preventing blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin intensity should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidently coronary heart disease or congestion, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to current knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa drugs and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients that may have to be transfunded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to reduce the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 for the treatment of hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before epoetin alfa drugs begin.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in the case of epoetin alfa drugs, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may be associated with epoetin alfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporine, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissue, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemastis, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, aneurysmen, retinalis), and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphate content in the serum (an enzyme that breaks the bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (excluding osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a Fraktur (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bonded acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecsis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta manufactures reconnaissance materials for physicians who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package supplement • Concontraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For treating postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous IV infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fractures, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) If patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under 18 years of age are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is treated with Aclasta prior to treatment with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">A temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients requiring dental intervention, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to patients who received placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney dysfunction has been associated with kidney dysfunction, which has been linked to kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were in a clinical trial in osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patient's disease paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently reported hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the orthodontic area was generally reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the orthodontic area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including chelidonic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study of 7,736 patients showed osteonecsis in the orthodontic area in a patient treated with Aclasta and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intravenous inffusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing toredal body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients from 75 years and over had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta posted an equally lasting effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta improved bone density at lumbar linoleic acid, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hips by 6.0%, the shear neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 post-menopausal osteoporosis patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with Aclasta in comparison to placebo an increase of the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5mg dose of Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U.) and 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta therapy in comparison to placebo treatment BMD on the total thump and shenkelhals at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta therapy resulted in more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% in total and by 4.3% on the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show fewer clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in patients and patients aged 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy morphbus Paget of the bone was investigated (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with 2,6fold to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when included in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg. of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decline in pain intensity and pain influence compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat was observed after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the 6 month trial could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients participating in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with risedronate, could be maintained during an average follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the big cycle with half-life-times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale elimination speed of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent fast resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450-enzyme systems is unlikely, because it is not metabolized in humans because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, compound-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledrononic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the creatine clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a Kreatinin Clearance to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Zoledrononic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) has only limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC have 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application the renal tolerability of Zoledronic acid in rats was determined by administering doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to twice the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the 7fold of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated exposures, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as on the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledrononic acid is a substance of a substance that is called bisphosphonate, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made up of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is structured insubordinated, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus again gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied, even if it is non-prescription pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta, along with food and drink, be sure to take sufficient liquid according to your doctor's instructions before and after treatment with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta is effective for a long time, you may need to take another dose after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta may take longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta is missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before the end of the treatment with Aclasta If you consider the termination of the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first inffusion are very common (in more than 30% of patients), but after the subsequent infusions, however, are less common.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), which cannot be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acetate treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced, which makes it easier to adjust type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial therapy, the effect of the addition of Actos for existing treatment with Metformin and a sulfonylurea resulted in lowering of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the addition of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoglycemia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirrors - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the acquisition of Actos in the European Union to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited company.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and with which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for using pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease) to develop a compensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular oucome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preventative advanced macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be continued until the laboratory parameters are precluded by clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be agitated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the average haemoglobin levels (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent also in patients with sulfonyluc and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral double or triple-combination therapy with an insulin or dual combination therapy with insulin can reduce the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market introduction, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolidindione, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur-incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under the treatment with pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone ALT assumptions above three times the upper limit of the normal range were common to placebo, but less common than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo, if Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures in randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation activated Receptor-γ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of a three-month optimization phase with insulin were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decline in output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study conducted at 18 weeks of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon while metformin and gliclazide were observed diminished values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, both about an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately three times the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was demonstrated that pioglitazone does not affect pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marketed pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindione led to increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur-incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a metformin combination therapy with each pioglitazone or gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decline in output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, both about an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal of their primary endpoint, which represented a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary vascularization and vascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone there are no cardiovascular long-time risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry the marker "45" on one side and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, an increased incidence of bone fractures in women showed.</seg>

<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a licence for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the placing of Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a fast initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has, for example, improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (through recombinant DNA to insulin animal origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, where hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients on the drugs taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 As well as hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in an uncontrolled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Actually - Peripherals Neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort which are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. however, an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in the blood sugar level can be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the subskin tissue Actually - Lipodystrophy On the injection site, a lipodystrophy can arise if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General illnesses and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system occasionally - urticaria, exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic edema, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycemia can evolve gradually: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sugar-containing foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with unconsciousness treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) is treated by a reported help or glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the work is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insuline molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspened according to the instructions for use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, where hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular, patients with heart problems in prehistory may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the level of uric acid in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also have a higher risk of side-effects related to heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricemia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits (including one of the current or current rheumatic ties and / or ggarthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the level of serum acid levels is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents since there is no experience in children and adolescents, it is not recommended to use Febuxostat in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Since there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxeat in this group of patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease in patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure is not recommended treatment with Febuxostat (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnsaw-producing medicines, acute gout attacks can occur during the treatment phase because the lowering of the serum acid standard can initially mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment (Lesch- Nyhan's syndrome), the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies, slight abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxeat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the febuxostatectomy and in the further course depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas no interaction studies carried out at Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to a rise in theophylline level (inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxeat and Naproxen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in Febuxostature exposition (cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxeat can be used together with colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for Febuxeat or the other used other active ingredient is required.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibiting effect of Febuxeat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxeat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in cmax by 32%, however, does not cause a significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not close to the side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatgruppe in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 vs. 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and which have been reported in all Febuxeat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxstat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events related during long-term follow-up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all cases of the Febuxostat- treatment group more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years).</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, short breath, rash, rash, bursitis, proturia, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in the rate of potassium in the blood, decrease in lymphocyte count, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mechanism of uric acid is the final product of purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cascade Hypoxanthin → Xanthin → urea.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is an effective, non-purin selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for the in vitro inhibitor, which is below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 134) or allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serumkreate ininwert to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Lowering of the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serumina ininoids &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (ie.</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects, notwithstanding their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunction).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnacid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had at the beginning of the study (baseline) a serum harnacid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheumatic seizures (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against rheumatism in the months of 16-24 (i.e. over 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the girth, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the top marks up to the month of 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSHs values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxeat, which is larger than the dose-proportional rate.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the cmax amounts to approx. 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage of serum acid concentrations was observed, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxeastat lies in the range from 29 to 75 liters, taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxeat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronide is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After intake of an 80 mg dose of 14C-marketed Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as unaltered Febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (30%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">Besides excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found in the chair as unmodified fat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean AUC of Febuxeat took about 1.8-fold of 7.5 g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh-Classification B) or moderate (Child-Pugh Classification B) Liver Dysfunction, the cmax and AUC of Febuxeat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxeat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, depression of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumors (transitional cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, at about 11-fold exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolisation and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, Febuxostat has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by lowering the performance rate and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, which approximately the 4.3-fold and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, showed no teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxeat can be used together with colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for Febuxeat or the other used other active ingredient is required.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1251">The owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as described in version 2.0 Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, is ready before the drug is brought into circulation and is available as long as the drug is brought into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="1252">According to the CHMP Guideline, an updated RMP is to present risk management systems for human medicines with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).</seg>
<seg id="1253">In addition, an update of the RMP is required if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data, the pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimization activities • within 60 days of reaching important milestones (pharmacovigilance or risk minimization) • on request of the EMEA</seg>
<seg id="1254">In some people, the uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid becomes insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low by 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine, if you have a heart defect or have or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you are treated as a result of a high uric acid concentration in a result of a cancerous disease or the lesch-Nyhan-syndrome (a rare congenital disease in which too much uric acid in the blood) is treated.</seg>
<seg id="1258">If at the moment you have a gout attack (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and swelling), wait until the gout attack is cluttered before starting treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be the case with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a gout attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you use / apply your doctor or pharmacist if you use any of the following substances as interactions with ADENURIC may occur. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of cancer) • Azathioprine (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for the treatment of asthma in case of heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies on the effects of ADENURIC have been carried out on road safety and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Therefore, please take ADENURIC after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from an incompatibility to certain sugars.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The individual weekdays are printed on the back of the blister pack so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day. • The tablets must be swallowed and can be taken with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1266">If you have unintentionally overdose, contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1267">If you have forgotten the intake of ADENURIC, take it as soon as possible unless the next intake is short.</seg>
<seg id="1268">When you stop taking ADENURIC, your uric acid concentration can increase again, and your complaints can worsen because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Frequent side effects (more than 1 out of 100 treatment, but less than 1 out of 10 treatment): • Collectible liver test results • diarrhea • headaches • rash • nausea</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease in which the bones are fragile) in women after menopause, where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarcera (swallowing), dysphagia (bloated stomach) as well as sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any kind of hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE must not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in diseases of oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Capsule form, white to broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on one side and "710" on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only taken with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of malophageal irritation and associated side-effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day of the day. • Patients should not cheew the tablet or crush the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal hemorrhages or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, be given only with particular caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, like oesophagitis, malophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by Rösophageal fractures, were reported in patients taking Alendronat (partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and patients should be advised to remedy symptoms of malophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrosternale pain or new or worlimmering heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an astophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, rare (after market launch) gastric and duodenal ulcera, among them some serious and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecsis of the jaw usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available that will give indications whether the insertion of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring dibular surgical intervention reduces the risk of osteonecsis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment of the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning at the failure to take a dose of ADROVANCE after noticing their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as planned for the scheduled weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoididism) should also be treated adequately prior to treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral drugs may interfere with the absorption of alendronat once they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without any clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecsis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but it was reported on osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, removal of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronat Insequence of an oral overdose can cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphataemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as stomach upset, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7-Dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.</seg>
<seg id="1311">The main effect of vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as the regulation of calcium, the renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fractures in postmenopausal women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and fracture intervention study (FIT: N = 6,459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the mean ascents of BMD with Alendronat were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years, 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at femur and 7.8% at the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies the stimulation of BMD of spine and trochanter continued; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus-talkers are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-grafting phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low clearance substance, an adjustment of the Advagraf can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be a transplant recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this conversion has to occur in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunosuppressants to Advagraph once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection has to commence.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients, which are converted to Advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients although there is no clinical experience with advagraph in lung, pancreatic and intestine transplant patients, received a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day for pancreatic transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular appointment of serum cancer, a calculation of the creatine inlays and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin to Advagraph During the conversion from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations regarding the valley level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in the individual case taking the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus-talular controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus-level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talking levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustments, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or in simultaneous use of substances which could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraph is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the basal level of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantations is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changes in wording or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood, no clinical data are available for the retarded formulation of Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1443">The intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other remedies during a treatment with anagraph (see section 4.5) can be avoided due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction in tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf an aqueous or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disruptions are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted because of the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels at the same time as substances that can change CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus-dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole, and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, it is especially cautious when taking decisions about receiving contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus could potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn to possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hypercalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side effect profile of immunosuppressant can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">In the following, the side effects are listed in descending order: very often (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As known in other highly effective immunosuppressants are frequently increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells, dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies reported the observations in the large studies where Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral Prograf was reported by 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In cases treated with tacrolimus, in 21,7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans was compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enrolled by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplant rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) greater (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the occurrence of a bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas Transplantation A multicenter study with oral Prograf was conducted to 205 patients who were simultaneously treated to a pancreas and kidney transplant who received tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102) after a randomised trial.</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric clinical trial with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after bowel transplants showed a survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional donation of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower starting doses of tacrolimus, which lead to sebaceous reflections (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocritic value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of corticosteroids caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus-level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not Advate is used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method referred to as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which enables it to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new anemia episodes with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Baxter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">During the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">In their reaction to Factor VIII, individual patients can differ in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.E. should be given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII's IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the magnitude of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 days of exposure is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and an amnestically known inhibitor development, a recombinant factor VIII product was observed for a different reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there is no experience about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), all of whom were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-level was observed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a patient under continuous ADVATE-infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- mirror in the plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th day of the postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic heavier to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed low inhibitors with ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients treated inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that pointed to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates the submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissues that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself, thus preventing infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Krebs, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, where Li-Fraumeni's cancer occurred in the area of substructure, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the answers of the company to the questions asked, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents, CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumours benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advecin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know CHMP to see whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programmes with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changed substance release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergies to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years or older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trapped to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impacts were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the trial the patients enrolled their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose the patients who took aerosaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who took Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane was observed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active ingredients or loratadadine (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), heart or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension) or haemorrhagic stroke (cerebral stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe permission to transfer Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to last as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since during long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstricts such as bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be used either orally or nasally as a swelling conventional Rhinologicum (phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headaches) must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerosaze is at least 48 hours before the matological tests are carried out because antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials involving desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with a placebo and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Disloratadin not inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the application of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency with the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a dizziness that can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible letins.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophila and inhibiting the expression of the adhesion-inhibitor P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with disloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of Desloratadadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multidoscope study, which was carried out as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects disloratadin were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was to the exposure of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with disloratadine does not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratal / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application application, the pharmaceutical covigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur under the application of Aerinaze: • Blood pressure • Heart chasing, heart palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmia • nausea and headaches, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Handling and handling machines When used in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerosaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerosaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerosaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take the dose of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and contact the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of desloratadine very rarely was reported on cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, seizures, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver locations has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophiliat (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup resp.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">AERIUS was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrangles, impairment of sleep and efficiency on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the 2-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS led to an average decrease of the symptom score (symptom rating) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in urticaria, the decline in symptom relief after six weeks of treatment with AERIUS 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">AERIUS may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadine, loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe permission to market AERIUS throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of Desloratadine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms end and resume when re-occuring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">For persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with disloratadine tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking AERIUS and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to light, which can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with AERIUS were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0,6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, with 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophila and inhibiting the expression of the adhesion-inhibitor P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study of multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which Desloratadine was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the nine-fold the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adult desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and reddening of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS diminishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine infection is a causative factor in all urticarian diseases, it is expected that, besides the chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, AERIUS was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by an infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadine and experience a higher compound load (see under section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the marketing of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus this ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane covering of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that identifies the human body as a foreign body) was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asperase should only be prescribed when the doctor checks which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when used in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to cure, however, can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared to other protease inhibitors with 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very limited to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a greater loss of viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headache, diarrhoea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals that are mined as well as Agenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines have outweighed the risks of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee established that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>

<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to grant approval for the placing of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules should be given to pharmacokinetic padding of amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place using the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing additive of ritonavir (padding), higher doses of agerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asperase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Amperase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the use of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules should be used along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppression of adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of the reduced plasma level of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is simultaneously given with amprenavir at the same time, the patients should be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol halts of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Regeneration should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases in which medicines were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defences, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width ageneration cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In attempting to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the amprenaviral mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, while cmax increases by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg amprenavir were twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and calcium can not be given, however it is recommended to monitor closely, since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin in combination with didanosin, but due to the antacids component of didanosin it is recommended that the income of didanosin and agerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavirenz (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Nevirapin's effect on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is required as Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of refabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg fossilrenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole a daily lead to increasing the cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions between substrates, inhibitors or inductors.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines when used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva, known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedi</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the associated side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances, and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of regeneration with kritonavir along with these glucocorcoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as amgeneration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, amperase should not be used in combination with Midazolam orally recorded (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advised.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteasing inhibitors indicates a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is given with amprenavir along with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the slight negligence of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation for amprenavir to be adjusted when amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Standard Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous amgeneration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During the pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances were detected in the milk lactation rats, but it is not known if amprenavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of breast-feeding amprenavir, showed a diminished growth of 12 body weight during feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the drop in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of Agenerase or another in the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg amoase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study mediation and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fibrous subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral untreated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivuddin / zidovuddin over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, NRTI- pre-treated patients had 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecsis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously treated patients receiving 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day along with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed in patients who received Agenerase along with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) when necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-polyproteinstages with the result of an education of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both on acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently permitted fossils Ravir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir geboosterous treatment regimens with proteasininhibitors - the described mutations rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral untreated patients who received 700mg of Fossir avir with 100mg kritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 out of 14 children, where a virological failure occurred within the 59, with proteasinhibitors not previously treated, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, I47V, M46I / L, I47V, M46I, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: N = 107), patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks following the following proteasinhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance testing based analysis genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I54A / L / M / S / T / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The implications regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypical resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypical interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret performance test results.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossiamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients with a fossil-renavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir / ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir keeps its activity against some other proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which can be detrimental to subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study where PI treated with PI for virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) together with ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with low-dosed ritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC PI Group in comparison to the time-adjusted average change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subjection threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbranded amperase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dose kritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, however, for cmax decrease by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing interval fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady-State over the range of cmax, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with ageneration (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction is likely to be minor on the elimination of Amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These chemotherapies lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of mice and rats, hepatocatellular adenomas occured in male animals with dosages which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test at rats and chromosome aberration test on human peripheral lymphocytes was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials, either during the administration of Agenerase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If agerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing additive of ritonavir (padding), higher doses of agerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">In patients with severe liver function disorder it is contraindicated in patients with severe liver function disorder (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Regeneration should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug dependent factors such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and calcium can not be given, however it is recommended to monitor closely, since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data are available for this.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Standard Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of breast-feeding amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) when necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both on acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir keeps its activity against some other proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbleached" Agenerase should be taken into consideration when using PI previously treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing interval fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady-State over the range of cmax, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dosage recommendation can be given to the simultaneous use of the Agenerase solution for taking and low dosed ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dosage adjustment for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycol halts, Agenerase is contraindicated in pregnant women and children under the age of 4, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated emergency treatment and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">No clinical experience has been carried out for the use of imiquimod cream directly after treatment with other cutaneous applied remedies for the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and perc area.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data points to an increased rate of incident reduction in HIV positive patients, imiquimod cream has shown in this group of patients with regard to eradicating the genital warts, however, less effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of the basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips or hair approach has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment period can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since no data on long-term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, so the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have a lower chance of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratosis on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lipevrot.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses on anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the underarms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were obtained, no recommendation should be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and considered probable or possibly related to the application of imiquimod cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treating the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and as probable or possibly related to the application of imiquimod cream in related side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by Imiquimod-cream treated with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of phase III are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream in the related side effect, were in these studies a response to the application place (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical studies of Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod, it often results in local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / flaps / scales (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimod spread was very common to severe erythemic subjects (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe scarring and carmament (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials evaluating the use of Imiquimod for treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the Feigwarts during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who had been treated with Imiquimod the Feigwarts healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Total healing was achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five times application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod, three times a week, in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a 25 cm2 large treatment area on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external genital warts, actinic keratosis and superfizial basal cell carcinoma generally do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod spread by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were lying 0,1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated obvious half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod in topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study for dermal toxicity in rat rat concentrations, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days per week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours performed in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − When one of the listed side effects you significantly impairs or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● surface basal cell carcinoma. this is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore an early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied with flat aktinic keratoses in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the best suited treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations earlier, please inform your doctor before you start treatment. o If you have problems with your immune system, do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated after a previous medicamentous or surgical treatment. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and nasal mucosa.</seg>
<seg id="2249">In case of accidental contact, remove the cream by rinse with water. o Do not apply the cream inwardly. o Cover the treated area after applying Aldara cream not with a bandage or patch. o If reactions occur at the treated area, which will give you strong discomforts, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="2250">As soon as the reactions are cleared, you can continue the treatment. O inform your doctor if they have no normal blood image</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, swellings of the skin or difficulty can be expected when the foreskin is withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications can have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not previously) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream because it is not known whether imiquimod takes over into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment differ in case of feignices, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the nipples and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin need to pull back the foreskin any day and wash the skin area below (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before using Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks a sufficient amount of Aldara cream can be applied five days a week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Inform your doctor or pharmacist or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to treatment with Aldara cream, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A degrading number of blood cells can make you more prone to infection; it can cause you to develop a blue spot more quickly, or it may cause deposition.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are usually lighter skin reactions, which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the place of application (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, blindness, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the place of application (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, thorax or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, sore throat, diarrhea, actinic keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used to treat enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycane, gags) are not mined and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS-I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or hospital with revitalising devices, and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly studied the safety of the drug, but it also measured its efficacy (by examining its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children exhibited a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alduracyme in patients aged 5 years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied to patients who may be highly sensitive to hypersensitivity (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be known and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme, a manufacturer of alduracyms, will observe the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transfer of Alduracyme to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyma in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with renal or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalising facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment, there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged period of interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single serious infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were mainly classified as infusion-related responses that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase III study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are performed in the following table as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing apparatus and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe course form and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once a week, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment, with a severe form of seroconversion in patients aged 5 and older (on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study), no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with no seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with insufficient to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 and one in phase 2) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the treatment of the enzyme lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken into the lysosomes from cells, most likely about Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of the patients had the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6 minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated the placebo group to improve lung function and the ability to pay, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically non-significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) until the end of the study showed normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG-level in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clinically significant changes for five efficacy variables (expected percentage-normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the middle course of course).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) showed a normal mental rate of development after the Z-score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental rate of development, whereas in the older patients with severe form of course there was limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different aldurazyma dosage regimens were carried out on the GAG-level in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once a week, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged 5 and older was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity with a single dose, toxicity in repeated application and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be seen as a particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2344">An infusion-related reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4 "What side effects are possible").</seg>
<seg id="2345">If you use Aldurazyme with other medicines, please inform your doctor if you use pharmaceuticals that contain chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of reduced alduracyma.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, including non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Indication of handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to application and is intended for intravenous application (see information for doctors and medical professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-induced involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing apparatus and facial edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint diseases, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Rereaction to the infusion point</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the package will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution occurred under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of the individual patient, first determine the number of piercing bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body).</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (medication against vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin (to prevent a lack of fluids).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood aspect changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, set off or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer duration of life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural mesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transfer of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each loop has to be dissoldered with 4.2ml of 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">In combination with cisplatin, ALIMTA is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with low-rate advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg / m ² KOF administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the phemetrexed administration as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pill rexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) during the week prior to the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created before every application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course a dose test must take place under consideration - correction of the adirs of the blood count or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are according to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Patients should not develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reducers a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity is 3 or 4 or so on when grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients who are 65 years old or older than 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dosage adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubinary limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of abnormal liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone marression and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophlic number returns a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophy, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicity like neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous ingestion of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients envisaged for therapy with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion before the emetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of an irreversible damaging of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed exists, men should be advised before the treatment regimen to seek advice regarding semen retention.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in decreased phemetrexed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution should therefore be taken if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be used high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Standard Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with decent antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except when it is essential and meticulous attenuation of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed exists, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to seek advice regarding the sperm retention.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomized cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exposes its effect by interrupting weight-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with several attack points by blocking the thymidylatynthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purinnucleotids.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, randomised, randomised, randomised, randomised Phase 3 trial against cisplatin in chemotherapy patients with malignant pleural endothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage over median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the food, causing roughly a quarter of the fats that feed with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no loss of weight was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with chair speed, chair cane, oily / oily chair, passage of oily secretion (threads), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Furthermore, it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or in cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to grant approval for the placing of orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalory, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and young people under 18, since there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • cholestase • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who have a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic drug may need to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">For most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years, the concentration of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the application of an Amiodaron one-off dose, a small number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects identified after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipasing properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lies in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipasas.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, was taken to block the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline: 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (starting value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist measurement, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 in general, metabolized orlistat in plasma could not be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients with minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysized Lactonring) and M3 (M1 as a breakdown of the N-formyl leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">In chemotherapies, Aloxi is used in chemotherapies (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate release for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied at 1,842 adult patients who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are strong stimuli for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate stimuli for nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a licence for the marketing of Aloxi in the European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancers and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with the Q- interval prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not used in the days following chemotherapy, neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five currently investigated chemotherapy (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral methoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, celecoxib, haloperidol, paroxetine, chinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not available, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common adverse events were reported in a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients in total), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of undesirable events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably no effective therapy for a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with cccyplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg. or 750 micrograms palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg ondansetron (half-life 7.3 hours), given intravenously at Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron who were given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies carried out with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Purpose of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of retinosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-value of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportionally in the overall dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations it emerges that at once daily IV administration of 0,25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), which was measured after a single IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the cmax was higher after one-time injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison with palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination following an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unmodified active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous visual injection in healthy patients the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disorder have increased the terminale elimination and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, indications have shown that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channel, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can extend the potential for action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and since alopxi is intended for a unique application in humans, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the failure to approve the use of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal properties that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino ransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data suggesting the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / /</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retardated in more patients than in the reference medicinal product; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the question of how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (skin infections associated with crust formation) and small infected laserations (cracks or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">When treating ininfected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo have outweighed the following superficial skin infections in case of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small firs, abrasions or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd., a marketing authorization for Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be broken off, the ointment carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infections, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans for topical application on abraded skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the middle retinobulin AUC (0-24) and cmax after topical application of 1% resapamulin ointment increased to reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosages are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on impact on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinobamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / completed or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / stopped, the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retinobamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, partially block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin in at least some types of infection may seem questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were detected in the in vitro activity of retinopathy to S.AUREUS regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.AUREUS, the presence of strains should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Pantone-Valentine leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% resapamulin ointment was applied daily with occlusion on intact and on laced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% resapamulin ointment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary uninfected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 smeared skin (cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng-h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphocyoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as in rats micronucleus for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither male nor female rats showed signs of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 smear skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were found at oral doses ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (equal to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the authorisation application, will be present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in Module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for the Products for human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you to quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment turns into one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cover, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">It is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years of age, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a seizure dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambience or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the twin-rix adult approved since 1996 and the twin-rix children approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same illnesses, however, twin rix adult and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the use of twin rix adult were also used as a receipt for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambient climate protection was similar to a six and a 12 month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambient (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) include headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, matridity (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, a. a. a permit for the placing of Ambient on the market</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for primers with Ambient consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If an inoculation vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured if immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccination may need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which includes 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels, so that in these cases the administration of additional doses may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination in the buttocks, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambirix may be administered subcutaneous as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambient was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheric, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matridity, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thiomomersal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerance of Ambient was compared to that of the 3-dose combination weight.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matridity on a computational basis per inoculation dose of Ambient, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">After the gift of Ambiance, pain was observed at 50,7% of the test subjects compared to 39.1% of the test subjects after the injection of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66,4% of the test subjects who had given Ambient had pain, compared to 63.8% in the test subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matrimony was comparably high per test band (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the test subjects who received Ambiance compared to 36.2% in the test subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matridity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of a combination of a 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after inoculation with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines which reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambient or during the 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted with vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years, the seroconversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for Anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, at the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambient and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was usable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received the vaccines either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with an Ambient or a 3-dose vaccination scheme using a combination of 360-ELISA units with a formalininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambient in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that after inoculation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme for the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambient was administered simultaneously with the refresher of a combined diphtheric, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates such as previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine must be examined both before and after resusping on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>
<seg id="2773">In accordance with article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state-owned batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways, such as bathing in waters contaminated by effluent waters.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambience cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the two vaccine doses have already been administered (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ill) vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has / has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from vaccination with Ambient.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / your child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambiatrium is injected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood clots. • If you / your child is weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your body's defense or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medications (including those you can get without prescribing) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has received / has received / has received / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambience, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambient is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulin, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambient pregnant or breastfeeding women are not given, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other ingredients of Ambient Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very frequently (more than 1 case per 10 pimped cans): • pain or discomfort at the feeding point or redness • Mateness • Reizability • headaches • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ frequent (up to 1 case per 10 pimped cans): • swelling at the injection point • fever (above 38 ° C) • Visited • gastrointestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that are reported for days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or individual vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 pins) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extended rashes that may be prone to itching or bubbles, swelling of the eye area and face, complicating breathing or swallowing, sudden drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like complaints, including chills, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, disinfection like tingling and "meisening", Multiple sclerosis, diseases of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or lack of movement of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Impotence inflammation of many blood vessels discomfort or illness, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal pain Varied liver function tests lymph nodes swelling due to increased tendency to bleeding or bruising (blue spots), caused by the drop in the amount of blood platelet.</seg>
<seg id="2803">23 Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly impairs or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data that has become known since the first approval of the market, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambient remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since ambirix was only placed in traffic in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposures.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in prehistory in patients aged over a month with incompletely enzyme defect or with hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split by several individual cans to the meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a Gastrostomieshlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without an active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle would effectively prevent too high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was approved under "exceptional circumstances," because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzymatic deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for the use if in the anamnesis there is a hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerant and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamide phosphate synthetase or ornithinkocarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AmMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of opesophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as associated clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat via the liver and kidneys are performed, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be used with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate on young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal increase was slowed and increased neurons increased.</seg>
<seg id="2826">A delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth were also found.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectetic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatacidosis, severe hypokalemia, arartopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose followed a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which in intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active chemically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infected, and the disease itself led to death even when treating peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate newborn at postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delayed manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithinkocarbylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonian encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis after individual release as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20g / day) showed no phenylacetate in the plasma at night after a large majority of patients with urine-cycle disturbances or haemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenyl acetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no conclusive effects with toxic and non toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a Gastrostomieshlauch or a nasal secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamide phosphate synthetase or ornithinkocarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain bark.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectetic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatacidosis, severe hypokalemia, arartopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen is produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">According to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can keep the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS because the drug may go into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, disturbances, loss of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbances and deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms in your case, contact your doctor immediately or in the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating the appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss taking AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in blood circulation (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin odor, rash, kidney function disorders, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS any longer after the expiry date on the shipping box and the container after "useable until the" expiry date. "</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed on the same single doses orally or via a Magenfistel (hose that proceeds through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (cardiac attack) without "stem lift" (an anomal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If anoxox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS in which the effect of anoxox in every single application or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) compared to conventional anti-coagulans and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or ascularization) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as Heparin, except in severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other millet or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angiograms in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency interventions or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If there is a PCI in the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolus dose of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiograms in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous captive of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a intravenous IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus-administration from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt release should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstitutive and diluted product should be carefully mixed before the application and the stub dose is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the dose dose of 1.75 mg / kg is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which require a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin for ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, it is recommended to administer a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and recheck the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value 5 minutes after the bivalirudin-bolt was administered without a dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiograms can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated haparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Unknown hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against millet • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of hemostasis system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial Endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most bleeding in arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients with bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur in principle throughout the treatment of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after settling treatment with Bivalirudin reflects the prior treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in terms of impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding like in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less common among bivalirudin as in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudine plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or hematoma of ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed retinal localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial involving a bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bivalirudin as in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is close meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor which binds both at the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin had no thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the case of patients following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST midge attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Bivalirudin as peptide is expected to pass a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite, which results from the split of the ARG3 pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin, is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can't work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisine is very slightly different from the insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter duration than a short-acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes where the body's insulin is ineffective, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin lisions.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% of human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisins or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effect strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The date of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin used and can therefore be changed when the treatment scheme is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which increase blood sugar-reducing activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathy like beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine the symptoms of adrenergic immune regulation can be attenuated or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin enters into the human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed in clinical trials listed undesirable drug treatments, grouped according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - weldiness, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual fatigue or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive hun-, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If it fails to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a suitably trained person or treated by a doctor by intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluacon injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisine showed a dose of proportionate glucose in the therapeutic-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and with 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose-reducing effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has a double the fast effect of acting like normal insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-prandial glycemic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-pranic control was achieved than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control like in a human normal insulin, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 Min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisine at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
