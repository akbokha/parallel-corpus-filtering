package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ ons ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may have more modules installed on your system .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Cr@@ ash . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cr@@ ashes if present .
the module viewing filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally show ne@@ sted order hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder represents the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the emap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle , which is switched over View color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if it is available at all , only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tangle will occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tangle .
in case of representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in case of the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be maintained . it will be frames to make the ne@@ sting of entries no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rec@@ tangle is square .
as sub@@ divi@@ ding the space of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoi@@ dance of space losses through parameters so that rec@@ tan@@ gles occur that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry View Vie@@ wing on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under @-@ level entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Image Gallery module can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Image Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can define the image of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field .
the Picture per line option has a sli@@ der and a rotation field to set the number of mini images on each line in the gallery .
show the file name of the image to see if the file names are shown in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails .
with the picture size check box , specify whether the size of the images in the thumb@@ nails is shown in the gallery .
in the Folder dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .

with the sub @-@ folder check box , you can use a sli@@ der to set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
you can copy the original images to the gallery with the original pictures .
use the comment file to use a comment file for cap@@ turing images in the gallery .
in the Custom color depth check box , you can set a different color depth in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation area in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under window navigation area or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the Navigation section of the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to , into the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; add that you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for individual domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that ref@@ uses to access this browser , change the browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the ID in M@@ SIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need to use the M@@ SIE browsers to access the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
this option is used to use the displayed browser recognition for all pages of the website you are currently visiting .
with the menu entry setup ... you can set the scope of information about the browser and operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , review and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the pipe conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu gives an entry problems or wishes . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all necessary information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developers help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; then we would like you to ask you other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to find news about releases shared and other information about digi@@ tis@@ ation ; to learn .
the best way to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you get &amp; digi@@ plug ; first time you start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ brevi@@ ation is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also use as an al@@ b library . settings digi@@ p@@ am set up collections
if you already have a collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ plug ; viewing each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during brow@@ sing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ searches recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it &apos;s in hidden folder . this can be done with extra @-@ h@@ bs &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder containing photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking a popular photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album symbol . for more details , see the Albums section .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ tise your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ word box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ plug ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Pre@@ ferences and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital camera communication . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Access Protocol , a widely distributed protocol created by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ c@@ am &apos;s thumb@@ nails can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ es ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ce ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the aluminum tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be placed in keywords , data list or searching .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ ename will only work when this is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ pack are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the disk , after the name of their collection in the alpha properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album import@@ ing images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select album Imp@@ orters scre@@ enshot .
in order to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you choose to sort or delete new collections from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the Album Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by Date .
the buttons el@@ test@@ ers , average , ne@@ sts : they set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this purpose , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you open an album in &amp; digi@@ plugs ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview insert ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; support the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the section My key@@ word list on the bottom of the main window . album collections always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview page . what information these are , you can change settings digi@@ tis@@ ation ; set up the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail page to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor for a moment over an image . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about digi@@ tization ; go . albums and keywords enable you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view and change your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ plug ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the opening menu . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ plug ; delete it , it is moved to the waste bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with key@@ word provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or searching again .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; fold up so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either by &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or click an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be the key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to shift the key@@ word . a key@@ word may be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; .
to select another photo as album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug ; s functionality with keywords , you first need to add your photos with key@@ word . this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail preview and select the key@@ word from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can forgive a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done , etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags Menu . the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent met@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a drop @-@ down frame can be moved over this hi@@ sto@@ gram . to select a time frame , just click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . this displays all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with the bino@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search which always filters what you have entered as a search criteri@@ on .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search is done . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select Edit , the form to enter the search will be returned with the previously entered search information . if you select Add as advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear . here you will find more rules for searching . for more information , see the Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu search .
the Advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ Insert ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enbank . any option can be added to this list with the search group / search group . any option can be associated with other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CHT@@ quot ; .
&amp; nbsp ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one . by means of a s@@ well the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : hands @-@ free sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ th ; finds the matching pictures . here too , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini Program . you can zoom in or capture it using the mouse wheel . move it while clicking the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your images contain Ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add the lighting table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the lamp with L Extras lighting table .
from the preview panel you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you choose to synchron@@ ize the tool@@ bar and carry out the zoo and / or the shooting operations on one of the images , you will also be able to compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pair @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button at any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lighting table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function , which you can see at the crossed arrows . in order to move the visible area of the image , you must hold it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both images will show the same image area .
zoom the zoom @-@ knob under the images or C@@ trl ; Mouse to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital asset management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the picture has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . we focus on the processes for digital photographers whom &amp; digi@@ tization ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , converting , archiving , archiving , optimi@@ zing , maintaining , maintaining , maintaining , maintaining and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ects and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need without inventory management longer to find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location , unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of things . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing simpler . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the creation page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ .@@ This ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ plug ; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts as you should assign any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that require the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s use keywords , keywords , as you frequently call , or continue in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically build the tree for you res@@ orting the images to the right place . re@@ organizing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed key@@ words are updated by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while the under@@ trees are tra@@ cked .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people just want to see your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in getting your photos .
look at this panorama . from af@@ ar is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you start to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period of time is re @-@ present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others viewing your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . K@@ DE also provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story for publication a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another town without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t she Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips using pictures with geographical data . &amp; nbsp ; This then shows the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tization ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work description . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the vendor field to identify who is offering the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright paragra@@ phs , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals this is for the majority of your photos only of little interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : panel failure , plate breakdown , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , aster@@ board prevention , life time , temperature , data size , multip@@ lication super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you &apos;re about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you may not be trusted for more than a few years . of course , you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that has a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD Rec@@ ordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes , even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum@@ ming mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection , they are aler@@ ted by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s antioxidants include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disc@@ othe@@ ques
in brief : dis@@ ks will last the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in the case of lower temperature ranges , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially read errors and publishing meters . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses normally can be recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices do not account for a lot , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware design , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy slots and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . remember , however , that not every plug connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to it , which provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since the over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers have over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV @-@ card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to work even further until the current runs . if you purchase a U@@ PS you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
keep in mind the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with current problems with the costs of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be achieved up to 50 euro ; A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are providing online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more dramatic .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are desktop @-@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you some@@ day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly concerned with transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard available under the G@@ PL . we can only hope that soon it will be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % of work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks already account for the share of theft of 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been spotted for a long time .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling fil@@ es@@ ystems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem arose , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteri@@ or@@ ate . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by data loss . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing data .
suppose you make your f@@ uses daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ plane disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , to your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for data loss remains panic despite f@@ use . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : that of the complete backup and the final differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such f@@ use has been made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync will only copy the difference between files that really have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain associated XMP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way than to be backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and want to expand the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition . * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not app@@ end it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ dc / dc ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , then you can create it yourself .
GIF is a proprietary proprietary format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports XMP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF has been widely used as an image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , with some cameras you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open file format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of cinem@@ at@@ makers provide DNG now and we hope that the competi@@ tor Nikon and Nikon use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . XMP is used as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can result in problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your archive archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut off by the other programs .
use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web gal@@ eries only , en@@ code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use it , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a completed indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file association for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the aspect features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ es ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download S@@ elected . the selected download button is sc@@ anned as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; nbsp ; . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you are using the All Download or S@@ elected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are disc@@ ar@@ ded . the list of existing albums will be displayed , like normal folders . in the section My Albums , select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you must select them first and delete the selected delete afterwards .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often don &apos;t use meaningful names as file names for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos from different shooting series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are related to the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for further custom@@ iz@@ ations , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , digi@@ tis@@ ation ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , &amp; digi@@ plug ; this is used to automatically create sub albums in the target album while downloading . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and digi@@ entered ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select High Load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the pictures should be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document , meaning a position indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to chart an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users who want to document the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle strings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ editing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few which work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the I@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the names of ha@@ y coordinates that are created , for example , by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ BO@@ T ; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that alter the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ es ; to access these settings , you need to select the settings dialog . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; firm if you click on one entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for authors : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate what the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here since this picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ fields . this achieves that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digi@@ plug database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ed ; imported without being lost .
image Descri@@ ptions , as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) save in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . thus , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types and digi@@ tization ; attempted , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category .
the Settings of the &amp; nbsp ; Ligh@@ ter can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the lighting table , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and light colour in the image . these colors are set here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a more detailed explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time to extract and pack . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high compression .
with the option TIFF files compressed , you can turn on the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but found in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed colour balance , which is based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed head@@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed head@@ lights as a continuous white . in addition , use the setting through whit@@ eness in the settings . finally , you can attempt to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ th ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the re@@ constructions option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color charts at the edges . visu@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color change correction , since it is done during the pipe conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate thus the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; check this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be compatible with the camera and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon which do not contain a h@@ ue @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not suitable for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth .
there are more options like the soft proof@@ ing profile you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is provided for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules that have been written to work with any program supporting the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick commands .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes activate or remove the metadata displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera properties displayed on the left are a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button automatic detection which attempts to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , where you mount your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug your digital camera ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can choose any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the Main Window Menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Edit dialog for moving &gt; images in the bin you can set the dialog from &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the paragra@@ phs del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you &apos;ll find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be implic@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; at boot . this acceler@@ ates the boot process from &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
hi@@ ring the start to new photos will force &amp; digi@@ tise ; scan the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ es ; if something was deleted from the base folder , you asked &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings using the design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ matter ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing entry .
the image processing contains a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the image editing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , indicating the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this using File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button or using the button The button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action can be und@@ one by editing the Res@@ ize / Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember to restore .
if you click the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the rever@@ t or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ o or recovered .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image r@@ unter , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the starter menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select enlargement factor
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can view it from the &amp; nbsp ; main window . see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sets . whole picture @-@ preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Printing Ass@@ ist . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; nbsp ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it will be displayed when one of the five Reiter is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab make the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ dations . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the schema in the following table :
the key@@ word display shows a search box to filter the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a select box with the key@@ word used in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation session .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section .
the page bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and searches . if in addition one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the inter@@ section of these two will be displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to give you key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry for which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ ce ; s concrete implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should allow you to make adequate background information about color management . in addition , you should enable you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to calli@@ bration my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calli@@ bration your monitor , as s@@ RGB is calli@@ graphic on s@@ RGB . so , the calli@@ bration of your monitor closes the circle . if you work as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you need either to calli@@ bration your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alization , offset , automatic offset and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic Cor@@ rection will automatically try to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest dot as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the brightness channel of the colors of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the balance achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ bing of all values in between . this is only visible when viewed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because a colour space with 8 bits per colour is used . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start with the menu entry colours white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image are to be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
at the top right , a hi@@ sto@@ gram shows that it is dynam@@ ically changed once you change a parameter . this hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment allows you to improve or download the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the stores save as and load make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images . it uses the change and allocation of colour profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter on Color Management .
another important tool is to be found in the color correction menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ is , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect created when a partially developed print was replaced by a short flash light and subsequently revers@@ ed the development of the image . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar process . at about 50 % of intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . just try it , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls and take care of how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is most useful . in images , the large areas of a constant color indicate that the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the highest for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colored pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjusting .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . for example , compression of output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the picture values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded again later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ denti@@ fied channel : this box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the associated image pixels become dar@@ ker .
if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected at the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hi@@ graph : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram will appear to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will also retain the general brightness as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for producing great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour gam@@ ut . the colour gam@@ ut consists of small space arti@@ facts that don &apos;t appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
the Save as and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ x@@ ed . the option L@@ umin@@ ance preserve is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating for your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
s@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm , light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shade tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ metric . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; nbsp ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; nbsp ; tool box add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . passing through the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , be@@ v@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set has to be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template apply a template over a picture .
the Menu Image Tem@@ plate can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the size of the file size . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you must enter your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder you have copied to the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the templates of templates .
below are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but produces gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colours with only minimal differences to a col@@ oring point . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of sharp@@ ness already during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this lets you call with the menu entry Kor@@ rig@@ ze Schär@@ f .
however , you should be careful because the results do not work very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can achieve it via the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate re@@ focuss@@ ing . with re@@ focusing , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it can be sharpen@@ ed . use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft marking and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , h@@ iss and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference in order to be applied to an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore avoid plastic flaws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . sharp m@@ ask@@ ing has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ foc@@ usses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de @-@ f@@ ission filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing mostly achieves better results as bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos; s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold is influenced very strongly by the distant pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular hot@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is bl@@ ur@@ red , but pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values are near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce the values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality becomes very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further pol@@ lu@@ te the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss &apos; edge &apos; . use this parameter when your bl@@ ur is g@@ auss . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed rash filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s edge . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the sharp mask a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mask must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be removed from the bl@@ ur . in practice , the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smooth@@ s the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as a starting point to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to fine @-@ tune the filter settings , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
attention to detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the attention to detail should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction .
direction Ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , whereas a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD rou@@ ches a high value will generate wav@@ y patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness ratio over all@@ es. p then defines relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angular step gau@@ ges da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha small is selected , it should also be small . be sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to release it .
the stores save as and load make exactly this . any setting of picture errors can be corrected in a text file and re@@ charged later .
it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the ab@@ ort button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a poor film shift during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius monitors the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we advise you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the color tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger . however , it also pol@@ ates the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase noise d@@ amping . this value re@@ acts as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high a noise and phase j@@ itter occur at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be saved to the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) , the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft sign and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; nbsp ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ actors ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
the stores save as and load make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button shut@@ down .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lights and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel makes it possible to remove hot@@ pixels from photos with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi Project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality rough mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you mount the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all areas of the preview .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the neighbor pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quadra@@ tic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances that it is impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the colour or gray depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying a equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly , to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction lo@@ wers the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; nbsp ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated virtually .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the General Paramet@@ ers .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ ghten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve them .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values that you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ ing- / cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction first . if you cut a picture an@@ ew and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal line of help . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ e- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Edit cap@@ tioning from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared video , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add Film B@@ urs if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control modi@@ fies the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green tunnel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter Film Body is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ bs on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographer , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ness 17 .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob will adjust the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter Grav@@ ure im@@ prints your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wavel@@ eng@@ ths 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects will require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shut@@ down .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ed : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from one focal point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels at one point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the picture to create the effect of an un@@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : photograph from a car or train , camera .
soft@@ ening bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the picture soft in the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour pictures or adding a warm and subtle light .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ends the image by shifting the pixels acci@@ dentally and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent rash : finds the paint basin in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects will require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . once you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it by mirr@@ oring or turning in the right orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Tur@@ ning / Transformation menu .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is how can you zoom an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a picture has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to t@@ ame the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . enlarge any single shot for photo files can be saved as a text file and then re@@ charged .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast at what it does , but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button shut@@ down .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . the image editing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rec@@ tangle , you will see this rec@@ tangle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle create by simply pulling it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool After Asp@@ ect R@@ atio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max@@ . relation button to set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
when you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image sizes are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ co@@ on help allow you to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divi@@ dings are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles aligned to the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden center is a division that refers to different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden divide is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . the divi@@ ding divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides more li@@ que@@ fied help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos to achieve . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flux in this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tangle of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye runs into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden angles discussed above . its ver@@ tices are the center points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are not equal angles of tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the inter@@ section points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easy , that you don &apos;t keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select the transition free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are set in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed at the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after fil@@ ming a picture you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the top right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal sh@@ oring , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
sciss@@ or your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single note this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to handle a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation .
because of this dependen@@ cy of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats that knows . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the file extension is accepted ; you can change this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section Con@@ figuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supported the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; this includes more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ pack ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . &amp; nbsp ; This clips are often generated in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; nbsp ; This is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display films or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play .

many tools you need to use the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ th ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft sign , noise reduction , re@@ focus , mask re@@ focus , etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area .
horizontal split without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the box to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are recorded .
the properties panel shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini Program . you can zoom in or capture it using the mouse wheel . move it while clicking the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your images contain Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets of &amp; k@@ de ; installed may apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor appears in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or is activated under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected .
a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue , and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if a further color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and is represented in &amp; k@@ graph@@ inter@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; open or graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ inter@@ ; in one &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphical ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representing graph@@ s . needed are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction in a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph needs to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can change the Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or from the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at program start , you can re@@ open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives you the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page opens the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph , when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can specify a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the seat management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph . you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or determine to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which is usually displayed at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further options :
here you can choose from different &amp; graphical ; layout algorithms . entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :

the &amp; ne@@ ato algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with a statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then run by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithm special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images and provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the SAN@@ E project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E installed .
if you open the image menu entry appears a dialog that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s default values to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window appears completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the target image options appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files are created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 , or create it by saving the image .
you can create screen shots after selecting the Import - &gt; scre@@ enshot in the menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have picked up the entire desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot has been made , the dialog options of the target image are displayed with the options described above .

if you choose the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in the size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. War@@ ning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF stit@@ ches of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same location at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below is included , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ rel@@ ing to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase it . always select it until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the Reiter selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab looks like the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; sk@@ ick@@ show
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth , which naturally influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press demo@@ li@@ tion to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production . the web browser will be automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after starting an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. War@@ ning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported for writing . please have a look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG en@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages of m@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD formats for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the media .
first you need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transfer is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , on the other hand , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start generating the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all cal@@ m@@ ness enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the Settings button on the lower right .
the printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ lamps . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information in your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently , or otherwise use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepar@@ es the photo for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of pictures to be sent .
after removing the images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , click OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are attached as attachments .
do not pay too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and re @-@ used each time you change it .
select your mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down to allow you to view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow appears . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File name option ensures that the fil@@ ename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . afterwards , you can manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used in the order of pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the chosen transi@@ tional effect . so you should test it before presenting your presentation to your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random sel@@ ects a different effect in each transition between the images .
during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. War@@ ning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the image , there are entries present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have input information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each is described for itself .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see image .
if you select another person only the images appear on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the image each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
in order to show pictures in addition to the name , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable picture for your keywords ) .
however , you must select which image to display for each individual . in order to do this , you must open the picture @-@ viewing window ( described in more detail ) and display the entry Categories @-@ Editor in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the viewing window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you are searching for an entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , images on which Jes@@ per but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick @-@ entry , the scre@@ en@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or choose from the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; start demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you the current date in the preview window ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview @-@ view .
you can also select a range of time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of that period will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .

first , enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; html example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select to create a photo@@ album ; export file to be created on the review page . you can find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed on the viewer without a description . for example , all images are from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been set are related to all three to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these , whose name you specify in the shared folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time recording the picture information , people on the pictures , location , etc . , then you have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images are stored in the file itself or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass that file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a double way . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting images is described , which you can view through the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the Manual option to copy to the clos@@ eness of the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy into the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want this , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Explorer menu ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you are the category of people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups , and if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) specify the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the brow@@ sing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and use it again automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Firma / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be able to explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , for example people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the dialog box , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , there is a list of the current category and on the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call through the module itself .
as the modules are shared between multiple applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications put their pictures in albums : here is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also include a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category of people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain much information as you have not yet entered any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you pictures , which will show you an overview with all available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to tag any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image was recorded , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all pictures recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always be using them again whenever you type information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , you can find that the names used are moved up to find and assign people faster .
if you prefer to display an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and edit these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nail and back buttons below the thumb@@ nail preview .
if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S. . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can easily drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that is the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which gives you another option to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . see this procedure in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this is shown here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now , the window that you can see in the picture is displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere without you stored on the hard disk . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . for example , pictures 1 @-@ 9 are visible . for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , thumb@@ nails are available , so you can preview these images . you can also not view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy it back . so if you are anno@@ ying about how to avoid the jum@@ ble singing of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images on it .
in the pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those you want to make available to others and click Current View on Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , lock and lock the menu item All except the current view .
with this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures to lock , thus eliminating all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all the images on the hard disk and on the other can either read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images by Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl and Plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image . you can just use the mouse to pull up a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out the zo@@ om@@ t zo@@ oming in the middle of the image .
with the button key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation key sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos will work in and out with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might prefer to mark only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just tag them all at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you display categories in the thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the character after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your painted later .
in you can see a picture on which was painted . to turn on the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
you can select single objects in the object tree . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the item and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu .
if you have modified Properties , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you entered invalid values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then , you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard changes with ab@@ orting .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for displac@@ ements . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different layout , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map @-@ map leader at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to rede@@ em a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the f@@ asser@@ tion bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... to save it . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog is opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to have a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the box section and enter the image detail to render into the input fields .
in the Quality Com@@ bin@@ ation field you can select the properties that are used by Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling integ@@ rates the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split up again and again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the Import Type menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when import@@ ing , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also paste .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dered . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object @-@ reception of the points to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera is using an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors .
when displaying soil , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors .
if you tick channel smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window orders section , it explains how to create and store window slots .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Panel Standard Window System : displays all existing window slots . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing windows orders shows all existing window slots . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected array with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you will receive a map map view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , you can &apos;t use rules for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the user button or the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert fin@@ ite body tran@@ aders ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or enter the input key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the layer , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog where you can select how to insert the object . please choose first sub@@ item . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . also , there are many possibilities again , but now take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the user button and then call the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color list you expected . here further settings are needed . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called unic@@ ol@@ oured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose one color each time and change the colors in the object &apos;s view :
you should already have this step simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the properties you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or the button on Apply ) , so the sphere has contact with the ground . otherwise , the sphere would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , the sphere will give a pig@@ ment as a color :
choose first sub@@ item and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then choose one @-@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can get more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following scre@@ enshot and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer shifts hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene is edited pixel for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been disc@@ ar@@ ded since the last storage .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing configuration .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new commands .
open a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color based on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field will appear in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box @-@ up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , downloads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up to display only some of the file types that can display the program as well .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of operation at &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no more browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ th ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains a link with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , so you should be able to use this language .
the best start to take part in &amp; show@@ foto ; to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you have to select a show@@ foto in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can choose the color indicated when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be in contrast to the colors with what you should display . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page row in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes more than images to scan and save .
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving for each image or store the images in a given folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also let the images appear before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the information you need on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; with the command cann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly treat these options .
in order to scan an image , the user can only start a preview can and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire preview into the window .
if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and the image will lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way &amp; app@@ l@@ ite ; open images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; wer@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without searching for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is saved each time a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression level when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; skan@@ one ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE through dialog for &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; output .
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the G@@ PL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; under LG@@ PL . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the G@@ PL with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as any other programs button short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the Global button short@@ cut by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ...
you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short instructions . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most often found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the modules needed are available and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your script can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and steer Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ sts the script to view the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece can be retri@@ eved ( for example the metadata or length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected playlist files , when a custom menu entry has been cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also passed to use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clean@@ up work . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with cat@@ ac@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki scripts side by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting Browser and Quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right one for you . and if your decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used so that THE@@ Y can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to rel@@ ive your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any difficulties in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section .
activ@@ ates debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the playlist , the player window will turn on or off . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option turns on the experimental function of the tun@@ er .
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
drop sound files at the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the location folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
when you want to save playlist playlist , the current playlist will automatically save when you finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
in order to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , it causes the play@@ lists to roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
changing parts to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s App@@ ear@@ ance . section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey outlined section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set up your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector , which is activated , for foreg@@ round and background color .
continue playback at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback will continue with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de colours are used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the Audio Output Card board lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this card slot .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if you add or delete music files ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card board supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece as needed .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send picked pieces and update the profile : this setting allows you to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshot photos .
Amar@@ ok just needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we wrote a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by brow@@ sing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then you disable automatic shut@@ down if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but they do not feature as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( default mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . this can be done in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance icons . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol up to three times until it shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined Symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ er@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok first finds the correct version .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also look for help from other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only enter a bug there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub @-@ window has been converted into the statistic @-@ window . you can find it under Extras stat@@ s .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to review pieces , the play@@ lists must be shown in the playlist . click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece . you can also use the short instructions on Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press the resolution on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and select from the drop @-@ down menu from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as easy as that : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you will find the playlist to save playlist . click on it .
probably the x@@ mms @-@ config program is missing . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual issue must support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include a MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter aste
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
when you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t just listen to an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . magni@@ fying the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less idle the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . do not carry out regi@@ sters to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t work , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ti@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report here@@ under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a whole list of suggestions / desires , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of Br@@ its Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and think that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music you have stopped prior to bed .
how do you get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button occupies one piece in the click sequence in the queu@@ e . pressing the input key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser you want to display .
my Personal Folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after Amar@@ ok start the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ oks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folders , select a few pieces and drag it to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , percentage statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this adap@@ ts the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . here you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing : selecting or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Edit Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term scheduled Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animations in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design Inst@@ alling ....
the icon was similar to the logo of war@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while brow@@ sing in the Con@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio @-@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which the development files are installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message of There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time has to be installed next to the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok under Settings ... audio output type the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ win@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box on the sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being looked after . of course you can take this problem yourself ! if you like , you can become the new , much @-@ needed car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver for Arts : )
listening to music should be easy ! for this reason , there are the setup wiz@@ ards displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or just don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easy for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the button play@@ lists . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist you will receive various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD plays in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you &apos;ll have various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current track or current stream . directly below is the area , playing time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . clicking on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , the PL and EQ controls are also located . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the knob is used for setting equ@@ alizer .
the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous track .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ alizer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ alizer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the EQ in the player window . once you select the check box equ@@ alizer , the equ@@ alizer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you find the playlist itself .
the context browser displays various information regarding the running piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you &apos;ve already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub @-@ window will drop off . the information presented there has now been split into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the music sub @-@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have arbitrary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the suggested pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click the right mouse button somewhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text under text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using scripts . if you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is needed to do so .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are left out .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are arranged by artist and a further division is performed according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - S@@ orted by artist and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your tunes will be sorted by genre and by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . critics concerning the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there is a selection field under the search filter that lets you filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time frames , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . furthermore , you can of course select your complete collection , whereby the filter is switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This le@@ verages the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to playback .
attach the playlist to playlist - Ad@@ ding the selected pieces from the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be done next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Mo@@ ve files to the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in various interpre@@ ters .
picking up the compilation album - Mo@@ ves a compilation of selected album back to a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again under the respective interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ lists browser simply shapes the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these utilize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Smart playlist players are possible . click Smart playlist to open the dialog to Cre@@ ate a New Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be connected to your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod as performer sorts in the top list view of the Media Player Browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them on the List of Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod .
the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . for example , when you enter : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert drop @-@ down files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop it . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR enter between the search terms , it is searched for entries that either contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 , and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and clicking on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order . entries will then receive a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , magni@@ fiable analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it will open the same menu as that which you can display in the player window through the right mouse button . you can set up the configuration via this menu .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , a playlist and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and repeat , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . on this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry conc@@ eals a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a tune in the queu@@ e , the playlist will appear in the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
managing the queu@@ e will open through Tools waiting queu@@ e management . if you want to add one piece to the queu@@ e , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . then , you can change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details of setting up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random songs while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Load . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so , you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New Play@@ list button cle@@ ans the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ assed and they will not be heard twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist according to each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow steadily , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Add casual pieces from any of the play@@ lists you have selected .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on@@ set .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where a script package can be selected for installation . once you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also use new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used to enable available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you will need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that you will receive a worse quality when repeated coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window , you cannot do anything . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copying process . once the original image is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules can &apos;t find . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback there , get back to community help from the forums and learn news .
if you want &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; use at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent free and professional audio coding technology and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files around them to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MA@@ ger : a full range of functions for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically restore all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new file name will be asked .
save the current project under a new fil@@ ename . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog box is displayed with which you can choose folders and fil@@ ename for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any saved project that is supposed to happen , just as if you were calling for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you called a file closing .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the dialog . it will have the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to start burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by the right mouse button .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used . it is designed for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only leaves the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , it is not supported by converting / decreasing a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to clear the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the contents view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , en@@ coding settings , and even options for changing the size and trim of black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the contents view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; When an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is selected , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows selecting and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the allocation of keys to it further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the slightly more comfortable K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task will be crucial to which the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter we assume that you are using the command line d@@ co@@ p . to be able to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following to the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Models CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String name ) void tag@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Ex@@ it for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily record audio CD &apos;s ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many en@@ coding who en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( these en@@ coder packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
become in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which en@@ coding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to break any copy protection ; even if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD @-@ device can handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copies protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( but the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which en@@ coder programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b out of the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step example , you &apos;ll find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
CD@@ DB will start the CD@@ DB request according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be made . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the coding settings in the setup directory - en@@ coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the standard . it must be noted that previously the en@@ coder has been configured in the coding settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for coding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , compression and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the correct en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important since both en@@ co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play@@ sets is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression ratio approximately 11.@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by teenagers , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you really want the absolute highest quality , regardless of the size of the file , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the en@@ coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : Tag ) when MP@@ 3s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters needed ( = button description in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs , upload / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves in the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note : this is meant to be the author ) . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and that &apos;s the way neither the artist nor the music business can be inf@@ lic@@ ted .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the progra@@ mmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more exactly are looking for source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this has not yet happened .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the en@@ coder . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined co@@ ders . more information about co@@ ders is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing an en@@ coder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) . thereby &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed en@@ coder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and read real on it , and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is considered not totally free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used to comp@@ ress the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the / etc / f@@ stab file and an attempt with the entries of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map box General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as loaded / ke@@ yed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
just select in the case of incomplete information , so that you will be notified when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the Map Map CD ; settings . simply select both records . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and file name will be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , if you download the database before . however , this is about 620 MB big , think twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card board .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers via the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work at the same time as the server is concerned , since many fire@@ walls standard@@ ly bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take over the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of pieces ending simultaneously : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw it out after reading the last piece : check this on to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
to enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be left to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to coding at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have cle@@ ver@@ ly chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we want to pick up data from the fre@@ ed@@ b .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ en@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successful data fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , then the &amp; CD ; into the drive defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look in the questions and answers section after help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album is displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; sets a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Play Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual commentary in line with each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
note : following the successful withdrawal of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; at the most allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all en@@ coding or file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder to get more information .
simply select an entry that matches the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t give the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover details of the &amp; CD ;
warning : this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out .
click on the tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the coding of bit 1 into the format .@@ mp3 . this will be read and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( from two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is en@@ coded and a third job is placed in the queu@@ e of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is maintained as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today . if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , once it &apos;s running , then the following is true for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variations of settings . best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow blank screen ( especially if at the time of program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot keep this manual intact . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; whoever wants to add or change something useful , let it do . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this suggestion .
strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it also has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real time raising of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Projec@@ tor , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop allowing you to drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( likes or tex@@ tual events ) .@@ k@@ mid automatically det@@ ects the method used .
seat support . if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the play from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo view and so change the playback speed . to reg@@ ain the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , pressing the space bar affects the space bar as pressing the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual event , others use lyrics event and again both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set it manually . so if you select the Automati@@ cal text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ a@@ oke text is automatically selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the entries tab or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you hold together . these are played in the series . in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection under the point Organ@@ iz@@ ers . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be saved . keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . again , you can select the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is checked , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Op@@ ener or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to ski@@ p a song , select the Next song , next song from the menu item , or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song , select the Previous item , select the Previous item from the menu item , or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map , which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making the trumpet sound whenever a piano should be played .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ WE and G@@ US charts , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; END define key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... END $ CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TION@@ S ... END
you see that define is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order , nor leave line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M . for example , if your keyboard doesn &apos;t support a shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a shot .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( a gun ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum Patch the Patch is meant , with which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone means pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to map tones onto the percussion channel . take a look at key@@ maps that are included .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and second channel , make it easy in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for Key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
N is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be used . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the View Channel view : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
OK , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
check the Automati@@ cally Add to Collection before setting up . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; open on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn off setting automatic addition to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ H. . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . Your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to continue on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really get a big joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me as soon as I may have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would like to stress that I &apos;m only about progra@@ ming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .

for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections from the Book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . when you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV@@ s and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / , can be changed from the View menu and the next editing mode . by cli@@ cking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected to match the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation while starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation while starting does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
there is a tab for the configuration of MP@@ layer in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here the path can be set from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer configuration dialog ; everything has to be configured manually by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play a flash &apos;@@ with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer must be specified as service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is to start in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always take a given jaw for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play from TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device to use and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port is to be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . that &apos;s why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , multiple names are used by K@@ MP@@ layer . at the time of creating this documentation dv@@ d@@ n@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any way I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be executed as root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom will be shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does every time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to compile &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be based on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
if you have questions or when comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within it a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , an av@@ alan@@ che ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
while here only a good knowledge of and ne@@ on ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do . to be able to control Lat@@ ex ; good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ wn for .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command .
the quick @-@ entry wiz@@ ard from &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; selecting the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings based on the document .
document Cl@@ asses : this sets the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; text &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : this sets the character coding . it should be used to en@@ code the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration they must be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in preparing German texts .
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source @-@ text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is more likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you have noticed it due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be saved by the high@@ lighting time and the ris@@ er .
automatic execution of the environments is automatically created by typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for typ@@ ing the text ) and the associated line to set the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu setting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files , the recovery search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ te@@ dependent file &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the current output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back panel search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked becomes the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer j@@ umped .
master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other involved .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
quick Construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is set to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should pop up . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; instructions for the sub@@ division are :
the Other sel@@ ector box is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , not@@ ation notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , a picture or another element .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . you can set the font handles for the main text , the tag notes , etc . the following font sizes are available for inser@@ tion :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two options available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font list . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or button quick build .
the source code needs to be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically retri@@ eves storage .
failure to compile the document fails , should be sought in the logging according to the errors . if fast construction should be used , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few items should have a different font file . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } suff@@ ices then to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes will only be over@@ clo@@ cked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no limit ( number ) for the modifications within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a phrase can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background is presented for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be made to better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should come to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . an external viewer must close its window .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converting or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as needed for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is made of the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool bar .
the preview search@@ light allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this simply set up Modern under Settings ... Tools Building are selected .
to run the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ selection . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer will then take place .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Set@@ ting Settings ... Editor )
if you fail to open the &amp; DVI interfaces , you can make a mistake . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the log message or in the message window .
the log file declares the source code error source . in the editor you can use the Previous La@@ Te@@ X Er@@ r@@ ors and Next La@@ Te@@ X Er@@ r@@ ors for explo@@ sives between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the fla@@ wed line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
temporary users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file from document ...
when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings can be set .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated inser@@ tion of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , the custom template can then be selected instead of the standard parts .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a template is simple to create a template , it should be searched for on the Internet and searched for as described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked by the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a comprehensive description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; word . this means that the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted switch button , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex differ ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can add additional spr@@ ung@@ ers . this is an own type of bookmark within the text . the quantity Edit Spr@@ ung@@ marken or the corresponding push @-@ button allows the jump to the next or last spr@@ int mark . thereby , this jump mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is likely to be one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; kate ; already excellent opportunities are added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is always supported &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit W@@ ases , the following commands are included in the text selection :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only predic@@ tive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the sections are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back shell ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will end at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; provides the key short@@ zel C@@ trl ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to read the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of Edit extract sales .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to make the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , j@@ umped at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , it is quick to lose sight of the above @-@ mentioned environment . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be dissi@@ p@@ ated .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; latex ; groups determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
with this command , j@@ umped at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , j@@ umped at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the bra@@ zen sko@@ by of a &amp; tex ; group # , j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group@@ ed groups cl@@ as@@ ps it can easily be lost to the above @-@ mentioned group . this command will close the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple add @-@ on symbols are used as seals . for the appropriate implementation , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple reference marks . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and leads two close @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic set @-@ up of dup@@ lic@@ ates can set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in sub @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French calls . there are also many other languages available .
when printing Shift ; En@@ ter Keys &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . in case the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , close the current line with \ \ \ \ with a line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be set under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users would like to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; trying to enable this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab is not the associated table , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some space for the columns position of the current table .
although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for the automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings ...
at the beginning a new environment is added by the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to set the complete list accordingly . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed from &amp; k@@ ile ; also spr@@ ing@@ marks can be frozen so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing the spr@@ ing@@ brands N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste spr@@ ing@@ mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there can be different w@@ ills for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as v@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of general language @-@ use are selected .
the command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters entered with \ \ begin and the inv@@ aded mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , environments are often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the execution of environments .
when inv@@ oking the complete set @-@ down mode about the setting of a complete environment or the key , Alt + Shift key , the command for the setting of the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient fulfil@@ ment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button .
once this is complete , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be frozen .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of extension for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; Supp@@ orts custom lists of off@@ sets that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... tile can be set up completely . as an example of a cooling list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word processing mode implemented over the volume of complete cooling or pressing the C@@ trl + Alt Emp@@ ty key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many more languages are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete satisfaction for all already written vic@@ tors .
this mode can be set up in a set of settings ... tile can be dep@@ orted . here , the threshold for displaying the complete satisfaction can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / native home folder . mode stands for brevi@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to point out the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for modifications and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the compilation of comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet designed end@@ lessly and can still be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .

due to the amount of documents available with the &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application ly@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all available documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are sub@@ divided into categories and the bigger advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures an arbitrary signature is derived from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you will use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this will give you a lt ; empty signature ; in the signatures section ; click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and add your signature in the lower section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use email privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , first select it and then remove it from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross to remove in the tool@@ bar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the Custom button at the bottom of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the fil@@ ed folder , then leave the current desktop . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the just opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , just let it select the current working folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file can be simply hal@@ ted . if not , delete the check@@ mark in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .

if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , it is easy to select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone wants the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start working with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all the plug@@ ins contained and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when you add plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the information of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Properties dialog .
the name and email attachments are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used to identify un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important as regards news and notes . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : it can be an event for information on the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone worked on it , or the sending of a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
event Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see recipi@@ ents selected in the recipi@@ ents list . the add@@ s@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
input notes is easy . it can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the names : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D ag@@ nos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in terms of tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of tags inserted automatically . normal size / lower case means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower case means that the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if ange@@ ha@@ kt , for tags that the closing day is optional , this will be added immediately after the &amp; gt ;
do not automatically close tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
re@@ fresh start and end tags automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by using the Standard button , def@@ aults can be restored .
default character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting here will be pushed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly creates backup copies so that a power failure or crash during the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own View ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings back to the default when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and kern@@ els / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range is used to control the possibility of controlling the display of warnings by hooks from no more .
the location to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source @-@ text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Tree Con@@ figuration menu , the visibility of node in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will un@@ fold when editing . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plugin if it is not in a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
rel@@ o@@ ad component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . selecting allows you to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
using the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ U@@ I :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , or she tells the plugin to listen to debu@@ gging needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to debu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .

assign the debu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a debu@@ gging has started , the script starts with the request .
assign the debu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a query has been made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the debu@@ gger performs the next script in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger performs the next script in the script , where possible , if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented boxes of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document when a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag displays . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a typ@@ ist .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but the element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class type class . the base class name for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list together . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is an only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
for checking the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools Dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Start window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , achiev@@ able via DT@@ D Conver@@ ts DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc can be edited . when editing a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings ... click New action leading to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut associated with this action . by clicking the User Defin@@ ed button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be input a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the quick@@ start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This is the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at default input . in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable normally only makes sense with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , which are sent to the default output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window to start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use its use , activate the dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; when available , so that you can enter the action when using it .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly regarded as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alized that clicking on this symbol will become a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document is inserted .
after creating the symbol it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings Action ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , if there are any ones , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared for a better overview by several separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog via Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note , how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar may believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sampling all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back up in the right folder . after neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ rc file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html day@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html day@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .@@ html Be@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ rc file which is used to support context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ x file in accordance with $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you have specified in your doc@@ rc file ) in the same folder as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , you can send an email menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , ship tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . the posts are checked and only made available when our team considers them as correct and useful for publishing . in order to make a full contribution we recommend to sign the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private g@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in case of problems it is warning and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in everyday XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ header : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion to &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; editor to be adjusted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these concepts and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one has to famili@@ arise oneself with these fundamental concepts first . this chapter seeks to introduce these concepts closely without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from tool@@ bars to actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local items represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only those users can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card holders with information and tool@@ bars . please check in and for further information about these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all cards , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , ski@@ pping to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area lead to another context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags on the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string is named a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool bars is displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste in your document , click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a day that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the construction managers ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with boards for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation bau@@ man@@ views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the files to be managed in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates can only be used for the respective users and templates in projects .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands per@@ taining to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , many attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the in@@ feed system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cards at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tra@@ der shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tra@@ der shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command indicated . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should make sure this is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers started from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up @-@ language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why evol@@ ving what has someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework , it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , taking out the oldest record .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the section on T@@ emplates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only a bug is reported .

presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files to the server in your project . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from time to time you downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects , you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or Project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved using settings ... added . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do this .
you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE directory , the loading will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the menu item that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar refusal if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules at this place .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above mentioned menu items . clicking on it activ@@ ates it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will disable it .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the item ; -@@ version .
select the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
checks the current document &apos;s syntax using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the change@@ over sometimes may require time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the map sheet mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
align the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project , e.g. after filling the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setup , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars as standard . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of server execution ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
get ha@@ ked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be incorporated . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to discretion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the hook , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or with the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the debu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . in PHost , troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions will be executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select Project ... from the Project or the icon Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is more than one profile , the button is de@@ fle@@ cted to prevent the removal .
remember that the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save this option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to boost productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to create tool bars on the tool bar . use and add . the addition of tool bars is treated at the bottom in the addition of tool bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action can be created , a new tool@@ bar can be created , the tool@@ bar can be ren@@ amed or tool@@ bars can be executed , indicating which actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set Settings actions .. specify .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates basically use like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or associate each of the existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms introduced at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree with global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally , special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can contain everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template save as local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project file ) the template will not be visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging , or inser@@ ting across the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create site template , secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it will be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can create he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or associate files with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is de@@ fle@@ cted as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default , and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ building block . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to file a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode functions just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in sync with the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; in this mode , this mode is active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta .... When choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatic . in the selection automatically the time span can be set . basically , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large gap for slow .
if you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows you to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in word processing , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using the back button or distance key .
the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool bars such as the table wiz@@ ard or Listen @-@ Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists have to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template design can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , you don &apos;t need &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
halt in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compati@@ bil@@ ity@@ mode , or@@ phan@@ ed holding points can be set in a certain file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ ename with no path . file names in the same folder as the up@@ loaded file name file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example loading a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command checks for a partial or entire agreement with a le@@ ak@@ age named QNAP or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP card that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is expanded according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a listed holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after starting any run .
break -@@ l &amp; lt ; FI@@ L@@ EN@@ AM@@ E@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; LIN@@ EN@@ O@@ gt ; &amp; nbsp ; ( Sets a stop in the specified file and line number )

if a value is specified for the search@@ result sp@@ ath option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , search@@ result .x@@ ml is processed by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , with the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html &quot; search@@ ht@@ ml@@ .x@@ s@@ l is used .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ resul@@ ts@@ .x@@ ml is created . this file can then be edited using a custom style template to represent the data in other form , If the option &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; is not set , the search@@ result file is shown .
depending on the amount of data to be processed , the execution of this command may take some time .
search &amp; lt ; X@@ PAT@@ H@@ gt ; &amp; nbsp ; ( information on which XP@@ ath can be used , see search@@ .@@ dt@@ d. The pre @-@ set &amp; lt ; X@@ PAT@@ H@@ gt ; is &apos; / / search / * &apos; )

start a shell . then type the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
add the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; added to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if the conversion returns 20 times , if --@@ repeat is twice a@@ specified , the conversion is performed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for it has been enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default
on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can sc@@ roll up / down with the arrow keys to / from the disk space of the commands that are previously executed .
multiple commands may require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local fil@@ ename on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML document edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ L@@ EN@@ AM@@ E@@ gt ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed much lyrics in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that did a lot of work was the comparison and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is also fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three source files :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you comparing and merge the complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ codes , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
ord@@ 1 Or@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 ord@@ ner@@ 1 folder 2 -@@ o Dest@@ folder c@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder folder folder folder folder folder
the opening dialog allows you to manually type fil@@ en@@ ames , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog keeps track of your selection and will display it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the Compare or merge folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename of A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in the Open dialog , you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button .
you can also drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment , you cannot withdraw anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will indicate the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees the color of which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the abstra@@ cts column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line will be scored on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; change &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the Button Spr@@ inge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the window , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by editing ; then in those lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queu@@ e ; shown . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear either in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window .
note : if the sources ignore the options when selecting the sources , Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page from , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . the Over@@ sight column next to the vertical image strip can also be used for navig@@ ating .
in the Au@@ ction window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . by Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture up@@ stream / C@@ trl @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . it also gives the option Sel@@ ection automatically . however , if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manual copying is deleted . be careful with this option , because you may over@@ write the contents of cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dentally .
line @-@ ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use jack @-@ back + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you are finished and restored to the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; Button Def@@ ault ... )
select a type@@ face with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered sc@@ anned . on these systems , the default settings automatically create an odd colour .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
when you press En@@ ter or Return , the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board , then manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then om@@ itted .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a spr@@ int character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others may look identical with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison although they are different . when this option is checked , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0@@ &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is de@@ activated by default . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic @-@ jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is further inj@@ ected .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts resulting from the merge menu . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character here . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , next to the normal one , a second over@@ t column is displayed with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just leave out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the recently used output file is retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to that external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out bot@@ her@@ some parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when you read a file , it is first passed to that external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ line commands to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ 1 in the original string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ pair . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ers is required . you can change the list as needed . the \ \ in front of the $ is necessary because $ is a special character and would mean the end of the line .
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line lev@@ elling . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any matches will be replaced by nothing , so almost extingu@@ ished .
sometimes you might want to perform several translations at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / PRE@@ SS / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will display the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without actually doing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that were until then are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories and fold up all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all the folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a compar@@ ative window appears .
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors of red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and the same date will show error : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during the merge a file will be processed after the other . status column shows skill , if mer@@ ging was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is right anywhere .
when the file compar@@ ision method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , you will be used in the Three @-@ Folder merge mode C as a target , B will be chosen as target for two @-@ folder merge , and B and / or B will be used for synchron@@ ization .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options will pop @-@ up , simul@@ ate and cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without making any real changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , restart / continue directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the possibility to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; those entries ( in the current session ) will not merge them again in later compilation of all entries . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 Settings menu ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ ing files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the major advantage is that this can be set specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not lead to possible rec@@ essions . ) This option is turned off in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed benefit will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
similar to the date of change . there is no true comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this may be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copying of the more recent file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it assumes the knowledge that the other file was not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original If an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the folder &amp; text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the folder will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or you can &apos;t distinguish if a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference @-@ viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference @-@ viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP , press the right mouse button above the difference @-@ viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select a C@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part Mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using G@@ PL softwares for a long time and have learned a lot by pe@@ eling into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or are going to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information .
you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , it suddenly stops ; No src has been released ; the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .

to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also causes identical files to not be copied when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the labels A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up p@@ ager ... and add the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop , and can also be moved to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is selected , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
checking this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st work area .
when this field is selected , the background of each working area will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is selected , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; p@@ agers ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in a horizontal and vertical groove in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with its contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign value to it . possible values are :
as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; use a part of the screen as if you read in the newspaper to read a magni@@ fying glass or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor is like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cur@@ sor . please note that the &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to paste it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
starts or stops the updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button again load in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Cl@@ ase &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) and that every mouse click em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer can also be caused by a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you briefly inter@@ rupt the motion .
is the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click takes out .
if intel@@ li@@ gible sliding is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically .
set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand@@ by after the last pressing of the user .
the best thing to do is use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which positions one mouse click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted responses . you can therefore par@@ ken the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if an im@@ position has just started . if you are using the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can even click a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor exactly where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , acci@@ dentally moving mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t make it to edit lyrics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , some advice is needed here :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text as follows : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will whenever &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . thus , you know exactly when the shifting time begins when it moves smart . later , you can use the smart move also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor falls short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and those that cause pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time that a pull process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , pulling and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets that are to be re @-@ spoken .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that is later used for the language edition of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . from the text@@ book books you can often choose the text passages you have used without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for wor@@ ter@@ ers . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can offset the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word processor .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your phrases ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you have made a mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the tra@@ jec@@ tory . you can select from it sets which are to be re @-@ spoken .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , speech output and settings , page wor@@ d@@ ge@@ completion as well as the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the Map menu Language Output , enter the command to inv@@ oke the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character coding to be passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using plan@@ ts@@ d as a language service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that succe@@ eds , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the t@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage will be applied directly to the input field with the selection of So@@ fort . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box , the editing window will allow you to specify whether the text@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when selecting text pass@@ age@@ book , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ age@@ book will not be saved . select Before save , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dictionary text@@ books . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down menu when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word transi@@ tions .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the field of selection .
select the language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to include only properly written words in the new dictionary .
with this option , you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words inserted automatically into the dictionary create a dictionary containing your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ ag@@ ets is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or associated key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text pass@@ ag@@ ets or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the publisher memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the publisher memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is located directly under the menu bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map sheet Language Output . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further spreading restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . licence allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / DE@@ 1 / DE@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . this option must be turned on as default input .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continuing voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only performed in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a voice generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text can be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not included a speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules that allows each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills .
reading text ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
speech output takes place via the speech patch program , which uses different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .

before you can use it , you need to install program speech patches and set it correctly .
for the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , or as long as no speakers are set up , the card holder will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card board will be displayed in general .
most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female characters , or those that differ in volume or speed . a combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is defined as a speaker . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ert ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to multiple print queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the Map Pass@@ enger Spe@@ aker in t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the board chart will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has yet been set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; stand@@ by ; system .
choose a type of voice , there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Map File Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . click on the Map File to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language training system . click on the General map Le@@ aders to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map file will be displayed and you can create text jobs and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , provided the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is selected .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr identi@@ fies automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is complete .
using the buttons in this series , you can start , stop , pause and res@@ ume text assignments .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card pass orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the Map @-@ map Le@@ ading General and check the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check the text that should be read , and select the text to read in the main menu . then , the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about events that you have set up . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ on ; read .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message in an IR@@ C channel where your Ni@@ ck@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech patch program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the speech @-@ disk program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . any job you initiate from the card pass is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text assignments are meant for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
string plac@@ ers replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can either be specified as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined string set filters , which allow the creation of chat em@@ moti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a more comprehen@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages on it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text application , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further down installation di@@ alogs will be displayed .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison template to set up character set @-@ up filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to be distinguished by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copied .
the string sub@@ stitution filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter apply if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string sub@@ stitution filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ator signs .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the board card , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the Spe@@ aker is selected based on the Spe@@ aker &apos;s characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and over@@ write the characteristics of the Spe@@ aker set on the board card .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text fulfil@@ ls the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , can give programm@@ ers their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start kt@@ sta@@ d in a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other window .
none of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ form filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wi@@ sch output . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character coding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter .

the voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a licence .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ centr@@ um &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ accessibility ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS operates with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be run on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the kt@@ on website ; for information , which are not yet included in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher uses a adap@@ table modul architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ert ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but is not necessarily required . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility or downloaded the tar@@ ball that is currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before using a speech synthes@@ izer , check first whether speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do so .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech @-@ disk ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr needs to be developed in such a way that the installation of speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can go back sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application delivers text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can provide the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a speaker , look in .
if you click on the Map File Spe@@ aker to add , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the Map Map Printer Setup is displayed . as an example , the module of the Module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text en@@ coding for text given to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , using eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sliding controls , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this grey , the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have to set up a speaker yet ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the precisely edited sentence . the nar@@ r@@ ator ID corresponds to the column ID on the Map Map Spe@@ aker .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed as a substitute in the order that is selected in the list below , forward or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio menu audio .
here only text messages are listed and managed . outputs of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you chose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set up special promotions that are always executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders continue after reading the warning .
message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you do &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is played whenever a normal text assignment is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map pass are only valid for normal text assignments . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on aler@@ ts . the map file will appear .
select this check box to enable &amp; k@@ de preferences ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read aler@@ ts .
if this setting is selected , aler@@ ts where a sound is played will be deleted by &amp; kt@@ ert ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ on .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you selected text pre @-@ read , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is shown in the list on the board of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is defined for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a final option , the action will be carried by default ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button Load to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes marks for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default voice that the festival uses when issu@@ ing SS@@ ML .
if settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , &amp; kt@@ ts sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this means that only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set limits detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit identi@@ fier is set up as the default . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ line recognition filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to get started is to select the speaker selection . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch on the box map to which speaker &amp; kt@@ am ; switch off the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then begin faster with the reading , as only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card pass , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit identi@@ fiers compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulator character ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set limit identi@@ fier maintains the character setting .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , aler@@ ts , messages or output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal set limit password filter , you can insert it again by loading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
the Map File Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection allows you to over@@ write the Spe@@ aker Settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the board card speaker ) . in other words : no ch@@ oral features are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the characteristics of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , choose &amp; kt@@ ert ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ert ; the speaker that is most likely to meet the initial set of features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is mainly when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker field , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use the speaker , which is most likely to match the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the final text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop receiving a text , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent simultaneously opening multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I downloaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in the festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio board audio , there is an adjustment speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker devices . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ enable either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML converter , and set up the speaking speed .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ on .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice continues to pres@@ upp@@ ose festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce the required di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone .
this process adds extra wra@@ pper code to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install the Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by choosing K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf settings ; create a simple interface for the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network setup module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , which displays the device at all and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux ; if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index . when starting the network setup , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which matches the distribution and release level . selecting non @-@ recur@@ ring settings can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed in grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system administration mode , divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings to show the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting can be selected . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . the net mask must be specified in the net mask input field .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the device &apos;s properties in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off , depending on your needs . activating a switched off network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be enabled or switched off , depending on your needs . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and activating the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support sub@@ stitutes a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator &apos;s name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records may be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry or gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ ds or down@@ s in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... it will display the Edit dialog .
the list of particular hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it is possible to replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains unknown hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine and click Add ... Add the New Alias dialog .
enter the name of the well known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of an especially well @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... Cre@@ ating the dialog known machine will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module &apos;s network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf may be discussed ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to en@@ force it in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concent@@ rating on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg , the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are usually used , and the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the Scrip@@ ts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected may therefore occur .

it appears the default k@@ de ; printing dialog . if you choose folding shut@@ ters , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time sched@@ ules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the base of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on one tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which beyond the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the tape and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension , it searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the band .
before throwing the tape , first the integration need to be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not match format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive assumes that a volume needs to be format@@ ted prior to use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the View menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog box will open for backup . in this dialog , you can check once the selected files and change the settings for the backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the f@@ use dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog box will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog review will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index in two ways :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup job :
the current folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the folder currently selected .
for all folders listed under backup files , it is true that only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter into backup files separately . every entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the Buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is incorporated , the command will load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware side block size for the tape drive is to be changed . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
the band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the band is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this icon is only active when a tape is incorporated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give rapid access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely you do not have access to system administrator privileges . under Linux , the protocol files normally do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteri@@ on or set strings . in addition , the list of the log lines will be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the column process . in addition , in the protocol file , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . level errors of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ line of the level indication . the colored display of protocol rows can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the sync protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu , in order to let all new incoming protocol lines appear .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; lets you display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There will be more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of reference from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following directory of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion @-@ archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it system quickly develops into a standard for the control of program start @-@ up when bo@@ oting the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; Kernel looks first in / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port at boot time .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have done something , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can run only htt@@ pd , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . thus , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it to the Insert -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ption number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sort number of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with paste ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sort number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for run@@ level X execution , but they are not executed .
if you &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) use , you have to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you &apos;ve made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled extended system settings . only when you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a map card that allows you to customize individual settings . other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix .
the card card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix .
this map file only appears if there is space restriction ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system if required ) and is initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
the group of cards informs about the group belonging functions of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Library field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
