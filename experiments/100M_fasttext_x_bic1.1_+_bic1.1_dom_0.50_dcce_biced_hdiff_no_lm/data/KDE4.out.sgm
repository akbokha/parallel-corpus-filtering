<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & Conqueror; -Menu on Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated as part of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mechanical translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions dependent without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & conqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & Conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & conqueror; select Settings Add-ons... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons package. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may have more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase, which & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & Conqueror; on Tools Crash. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module viewing filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar under Extras View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to graphically show nested order hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size of a folder represents the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the emap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if it is available at all, only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangle will occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in case of the Treemap in & FSView, this target will not always be maintained. it will be frames to make the nesting of entries no longer available. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As subdividing the space of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through parameters so that rectangles occur that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry View Viewing on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under-level entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image Gallery module can be found in the & Conqueror; -menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Image Gallery module, a dialog opens with which you can define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Picture per line option has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini images on each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Show the file name of the image to see if the file names are shown in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the picture size check box, specify whether the size of the images in the thumbnails is shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the sub-folder check box, you can use a slider to set the subfolder to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can copy the original images to the gallery with the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment file to use a comment file for capturing images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Custom color depth check box, you can set a different color depth in the original pictures for the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation area in the & Conqueror; -menu under window navigation area or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the Navigation section of the & Conqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to, into the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the & Conqueror; add that you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & conqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the ID in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need to use the MSIE browsers to access the & Conqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use the own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">This option is used to use the displayed browser recognition for all pages of the website you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry setup... you can set the scope of information about the browser and operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & Conqueror; module check your & CSS; style templates & & HTML; documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, review and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the pipe conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digiplug; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digiplug; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu gives an entry problems or wishes. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all necessary information is already registered here. follow only the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicame; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developers help each other. if you are a regular user of & digiplug; then we would like you to ask you other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; homepage to find news about releases shared and other information about digitisation; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you get & digiplug; first time you start, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter a path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abbreviation is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; will also use as an alb library. settings digipam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as a base folder. & digiplug; viewing each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; dursearches recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it's in hidden folder. this can be done with extra-hbs & digitisation; do this by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder containing photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking a popular photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album symbol. for more details, see the Albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can set up & digitise your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so & digiplug; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh DecoderPreferences and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; used the program gPhoto2 for digital camera communication. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Access Protocol, a widely distributed protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that digicam's thumbnails can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digiplug; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitization; KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digies; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digice; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the aluminum tree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture can not be placed in keywords, data list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename will only work when this is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure in the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digipack are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the disk, after the name of their collection in the alpha properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Importers screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you choose to sort or delete new collections from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eltesters, average, nests: they set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this purpose, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you open an album in & digiplugs; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in context menu & quot; As album preview insert; in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiplug; support the input of keyword for individual photos in the section My keyword list on the bottom of the main window. album collections always include all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview page. what information these are, you can change settings digitisation; set up the albums page and adjust the thumbnail page to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse-cursor for a moment over an image. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digitization; go. albums and keywords enable you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Picture Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with the image editing you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digiplug; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the opening menu. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digiplug; delete it, it is moved to the waste bin of & kde; move. F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos using the data. & digiplug; used either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select one month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; fold up so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either by & quot; My keyword quot; or click an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to shift the keyword. a keyword may be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as album symbol, click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use & digiplug; s functionality with keywords, you first need to add your photos with keyword. this can happen in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; alternatively, you can also click on the thumbnail preview and select the keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can forgive a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags Menu. the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent metogram of the number of images per time unit. a drop-down frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, just click on the lower rectangle of the selection box, which indicates the time unit. this displays all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search is done. the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select Edit, the form to enter the search will be returned with the previously entered search information. if you select Add as advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear. here you will find more rules for searching. for more information, see the Advanced Search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, which you can search in certain fields of & digiInsert; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. any option can be added to this list with the search group / search group. any option can be associated with other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least.... furthermore, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& nbsp; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one. by means of a swell the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digith; finds the matching pictures. here too, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini Program. you can zoom in or capture it using the mouse wheel. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this assumes that your images contain Geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the lighting table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window opened. if you are back in & digiplug; main window, you can quickly open the lamp with L Extras lighting table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview panel you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you choose to synchronize the toolbar and carry out the zoo and / or the shooting operations on one of the images, you will also be able to compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pair-wise navigating from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button at any thumbnail to display it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the lighting table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivelling function, which you can see at the crossed arrows. in order to move the visible area of the image, you must hold it and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom the zoom-knob under the images or Ctrl; Mouse to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital asset management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the picture has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. we focus on the processes for digital photographers whom & digitization; use. we consider downloading, renaming, converting, converting, archiving, archiving, optimizing, maintaining, maintaining, maintaining, maintaining and export of image files.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need without inventory management longer to find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digiplug; the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location, unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of things. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing simpler. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the creation page of the metadata in & digitis.This ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, & digiplug; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts as you should assign any photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures that require the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's use keywords, keywords, as you frequently call, or continue in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; automatically build the tree for you resorting the images to the right place. reorganizing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are updated by & digikam; updated while the undertrees are tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people just want to see your photos only, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in getting your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from afar is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you that this is the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period of time is re-present, you may even hear the silence. so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. KDE also provides you with a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these captions are exported to your wishes in the caption and / or title of the web gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story for publication a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another town without a navigation system? wasn't she Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips using pictures with geographical data. & nbsp; This then shows the photos at the location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digitization; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's identity, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can no longer be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's work description. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the vendor field to identify who is offering the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright paragraphs, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for individuals this is for the majority of your photos only of little interest. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digitisation; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: panel failure, plate breakdown, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, asterboard prevention, life time, temperature, data size, multiplication superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you're about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you may not be trusted for more than a few years. of course, you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that has a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD Recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes, even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control summing mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control summing. despite this massive protection, they are alerted by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB, and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. also read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store in a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's antioxidants include a new disk, but not the data. Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: discotheques</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks will last the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in the case of lower temperature ranges, the error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART errors indicate the imminent failure. these are especially read errors and publishing meters. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses normally can be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not account for a lot, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause serious keyboards, complete data loss, hardware design, damaged motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy slots and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. remember, however, that not every plug connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to it, which provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since the overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers have overvoltage contactors that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV-card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to work even further until the current runs. if you purchase a UPS you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Keep in mind the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with current problems with the costs of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be achieved up to 50 euro; A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com are providing online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more, in case of Flickr more dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desktop-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undetected until you someday open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly concerned with transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard available under the GPL. we can only hope that soon it will be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss on the notebook and 46% of workstation systems. notebooks already account for the share of theft of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been spotted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling filesystems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem arose, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by data loss. so, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, replacing plates or resizing data.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs to the neighboring house, to your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for data loss remains panic despite fuse. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: that of the complete backup and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such fuse has been made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only sampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync will only copy the difference between files that really have been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way than to be backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and want to expand the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition. * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new disk is / dev / sdc / dc; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software to read, then you can create it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary proprietary format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, with some cameras you can save your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open file format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of cinematmakers provide DNG now and we hope that the competitor Nikon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block & quot; technology of the 90s. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP is used as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can result in problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your archive archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were then cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galeries only, encode them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use it, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a completed indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file association for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the aspect features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's note, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digitisation; or image editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digies;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected download button is scanned as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been downloaded from & nbsp;. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you are using the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are discarded. the list of existing albums will be displayed, like normal folders. in the section My Albums, select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by using the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, you must select them first and delete the selected delete afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so, you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded from the camera before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often don't use meaningful names as file names for the photos. the filenames are usually reused after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you load photos from different shooting series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two are related to the author in the Standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. turn on the Date & Time option. for further customizations, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, digitisation; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, & digiplug; this is used to automatically create sub albums in the target album while downloading. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and digientered; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select High Load. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digiplug; you where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document, meaning a position indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to chart an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users who want to document the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle strings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-editing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few which work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in the gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Iiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the names of hay coordinates that are created, for example, by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiBOT; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that alter the behaviour of & digies; to access these settings, you need to select the settings dialog. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. so you set the default behavior of & digiplug; firm if you click on one entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for authors: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this may be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate what the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here since this picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC-fields. this achieves that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digiplug database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digied; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image Descriptions, as embedded captions (JFIF) save in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. thus, your captions can also be read by other images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types and digitization; attempted, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digiplug; album folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The Settings of the & nbsp; Lighter can be set on this page to the default values. however, if you then open the lighting table, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and light colour in the image. these colors are set here. in image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time to extract and pack. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value on a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed, you can turn on the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but found in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. at present, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed colour balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed headlights, so the parts of your images are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed headlights as a continuous white. in addition, use the setting through whiteness in the settings. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digith; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the reconstructions option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitisation; to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color charts at the edges. visuinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color change correction, since it is done during the pipe conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions on how to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate thus the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digiplug; check this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your images are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be compatible with the camera and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon which do not contain a hue-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not suitable for conversions at 16-bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the soft proofing profile you can emulate as your image would be given from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is provided for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digiplug; many modules that have been written to work with any program supporting the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes activate or remove the metadata displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties displayed on the left are a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button automatic detection which attempts to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / or, where you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digiplug your digital camera; you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the Main Window Menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Edit dialog for moving &gt; images in the bin you can set the dialog from & digiplug; when deleting a photo in an album. in the paragraphs deleting a photo and deleting an album, you'll find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be implicitly supported by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digiplug; at boot. this accelerates the boot process from & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Hiring the start to new photos will force & digitise; scan the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digies; if something was deleted from the base folder, you asked & digiplug; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digiplug; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings using the design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digimatter; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, indicating the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this using File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button or using the button The button Restore the Image Processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or recovered. the last action can be undone by editing the Resize / Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to remember to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you click the & LMB; press a moment longer via the revert or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undo or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image runter, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the starter menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select enlargement factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the settings dialog by & digiplug; you can view it from the & nbsp; main window. see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or whole sets. whole picture-preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Printing Assist. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & nbsp; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it will be displayed when one of the five Reiter is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab make the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC-labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gradations. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC-field Urgency. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword display shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a select box with the keyword used in this & digitisation session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - datum-, keyword and searches. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to give you keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry for which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digice; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should allow you to make adequate background information about color management. in addition, you should enable you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callibration my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibration your monitor, as sRGB is calligraphic on sRGB. so, the callibration of your monitor closes the circle. if you work as in the colour space of sRGB, you need either to callibration your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalization, offset, automatic offset and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic Correction will automatically try to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest dot as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the brightness channel of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the balance achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new jibing of all values in between. this is only visible when viewed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because a colour space with 8 bits per colour is used. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16 bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. they start with the menu entry colours white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image are to be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram shows that it is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment allows you to improve or download the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The stores save as and load make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images. it uses the change and allocation of colour profiles. colour mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter on Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to be found in the color correction menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & nbsp; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solaris, also called Sabatier, was an effect created when a partially developed print was replaced by a short flash light and subsequently reversed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at about 50% of intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the sliders for the purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is most useful. in images, the large areas of a constant color indicate that the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the highest for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colored pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input values. for example, compression of output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the picture values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded again later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifidentified channel: this box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">If you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected at the Luminance Channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digiplug; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the higraph: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will also retain the general brightness as the channel blender then is THE tool for producing great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour gamut. the colour gamut consists of small space artifacts that don't appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjuxed. the option Luminance preserve is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating for your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm, light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shade tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepimetric. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & nbsp; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop kind portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the altered under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & nbsp; tool box add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. passing through the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool Following aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set has to be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu Image Template can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the size of the file size. if you want to add your template to & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must enter your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder you have copied to the stencil files. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the templates of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but produces grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colours with only minimal differences to a coloring point. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this lets you call with the menu entry Korrigze Schärf.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful because the results do not work very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool. you can achieve it via the menu item Corrigate refocussing. with refocusing, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it can be sharpened. use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate soft marking and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, hiss and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference in order to be applied to an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore avoid plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">The original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). sharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocussing refocusses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted de-fission filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocerenquot; in which it reverses the defocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing mostly achieves better results as blurred masked. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's fold. the Gauß 's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's fold is influenced very strongly by the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular hotness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred, but pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values are near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce the values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality becomes very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further pollute the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss' edge '. use this parameter when your blur is gauss. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed rash filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hotness or the Gauss's edge. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the sharp mask a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp mask must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be removed from the blur. in practice, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smooths the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine-tune the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention to detail p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should be preserved in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the attention to detail should always be subordinated to the direction of direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, whereas a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD rouches a high value will generate wavy patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness ratio over alles. p then defines relative smoothness. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is traversed. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step gauges da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha small is selected, it should also be small. be sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The stores save as and load make exactly this. any setting of picture errors can be corrected in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">It can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & nbsp; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise which can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius monitors the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we advise you to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the color tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger. however, it also polates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase noise damping. this value reacts as quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high a noise and phase jitter occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2), the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to sharpen. use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate soft sign and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & nbsp; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm it produces some compression & quot; artefactors; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The stores save as and load make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected one (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lights and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel makes it possible to remove hotpixels from photos with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality rough mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you mount the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all areas of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbor pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock will be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & nbsp; Vignetting Correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances that it is impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filmenand the colour or gray depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying a equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly, to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction lowers the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & nbsp; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grade corrects the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the opposite sign of the General Parameters.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve them.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonning- / cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. best perform this correction first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal line of help. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Edit captioning from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared video, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add Film Burs if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control modifies the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green tunnel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filming effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & nbsp; Filter Film Body is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grabs on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographer, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the film sensitivity used is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & nbsp; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & nbsp; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharp.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2) brush size for this 640-pixel size is 1 and smoothness 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & nbsp; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower knob will adjust the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & nbsp; Filter Gravure imprints your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & nbsp; Filter Gravure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondaric landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelengths 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelengths 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects will require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpened: blurred the image along star-shaped lines starting from one focal point. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by rotating the pixels at one point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: wipes the picture to create the effect of an unfocused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipes the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: photograph from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: wipes the picture soft in the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour pictures or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blends the image by shifting the pixels accidentally and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent rash: finds the paint basin in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects will require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Beenden button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of droplets on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with the & digiplug; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. once you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it by mirroring or turning in the right orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Turning / Transformation menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you zoom an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a picture has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to tame the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. enlarge any single shot for photo files can be saved as a text file and then recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast at what it does, but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. the image editing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle, you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create by simply pulling it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with cutting, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After Aspect Ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relation button to set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the editing tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image sizes are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cocoon help allow you to show help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious dividings are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles aligned to the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden center is a division that refers to different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden divide is the irrational number 1.618033988... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers. the dividing divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquefied help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos to achieve. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results in the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flux in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye runs into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden angles discussed above. its vertices are the center points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are not equal angles of triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easy, that you don't keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. select the transition free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are set in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming a picture you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming cutting out of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle top left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shoring, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissor your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press on presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is wiped a bit. for a single note this effect is usually negligible, but two shots generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to handle a large number of image formats with & digitisation.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiplug; shows only files in formats that knows. this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digiplug; the file extension is accepted; you can change this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from & digiplug; in the section Configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with & digitisation;.</seg>

<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. & nbsp; This clips are often generated in the AVI- or MPEG format. & nbsp; This is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in options to display films or edit. if you click on a movie file & digiplug; the & kde; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="703">Vertically split without duplicate. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal split without duplicate. the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show overexposure and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the box to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the left lower corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="711">The properties panel shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data are from EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini Program. you can zoom in or capture it using the mouse wheel. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this assumes that your images contain Geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets of & kde; installed may apply either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor appears in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It indicates the color next to it. the color is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; include, are obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphical viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; recomputes the graph and is represented in & kgraphinterviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or graph in & kgraphinter; in one & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphical viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphical; -Tool & dot; for representing graphs. needed are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate window. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction in a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph needs to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; if you want to change your decision later, you can change the Settings kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphite file outside of a running & kgraphical viewer, & eg; in the file browser or from the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraph viewer; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut store page gives you the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page opens the possibility to specify the behaviour of & kgraph, when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can specify a default behavior in this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The seat management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraph. you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the last session files) or determine to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which is usually displayed at a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphical; layout algorithms. entries, as described on the web page of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of aligned graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. it uses the Kamada Kawai algorithm, which is synonymous with a statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspring model layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fructman-Reingold heuristic, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then run by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graphene after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the graphviz; algorithm special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise, it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Show the What is the -Mouse pointer. click on one & GUI; -element with this mouse-cursor to get further help to this item (if available).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module can read images and provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the SANE project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">If you open the image menu entry appears a dialog that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears as you can replace the default ducrhe's default values to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window appears completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the target image options appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files are created. you also need to select the folder & # 160, or create it by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screen shots after selecting the Import - &gt; screenshot in the menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have picked up the entire desktop, only the window under the mouse will be read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image are displayed with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world online, show photos of your camera phone online and show your photos in a safe and private way to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the exporting module expires to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click on the Ok button to start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF stitches of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographic Localization Korrelator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears. to run a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same location at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below is included, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for pictures, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correling to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and increase it. always select it until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the Reiter selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab looks like the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page opens in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer, & eg; skickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth, which naturally influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press demolition to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically shut down. therefore, you can read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production. the web browser will be automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After starting an image is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list below kde-imaging @ kde.org. Warning: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the mailinglist kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the Metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported for writing. please have a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages of mjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD formats for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the media.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">Next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transfer is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, on the other hand, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your wishes, you can start generating the movie with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all calmness enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button on the lower right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard photoglamps. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and launch the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information in your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently, or otherwise use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, start number and timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the photo for the photo print. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">After removing the images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, click OK to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you select are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay too many images at once. most email accounts have limitations to the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and re-used each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down to allow you to view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow appears. you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File name option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop. afterwards, you can manually terminate it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used in the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. the best distance, however, depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. so you should test it before presenting your presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. random selects a different effect in each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous one and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list below kde-imaging @ kde.org. Warning: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; by these browsing, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the image, there are entries present in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have input information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course to view the current thumbnails. in the following, each is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser's view changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images appear on which both individuals are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand pictures to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to show pictures in addition to the name, select the button that is located on the right side of the toolbar. in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have a suitable picture for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select which image to display for each individual. in order to do this, you must open the picture-viewing window (described in more detail) and display the entry Categories-Editor in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the viewing window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are searching for an entry in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either a part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, images on which Jesper but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick-entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog choose the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or choose from the menu entry kphotoalbum; start demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; view the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image will show you the current date in the preview window) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview-view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of that period will be displayed in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML pages with your images. one is integrated into & kphotoalbum; the one is integrated into & kphotoalbum; in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described; the integrated version is described, which you can access through the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; html example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select to create a photoalbum; export file to be created on the review page. you can find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed on the viewer without a description. for example, all images are from a party. note that all images are exported from a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a base folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will launch in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been set are related to all three to base folders and URLs. a subfolder is created in these, whose name you specify in the shared folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time recording the picture information, people on the pictures, location, etc., then you have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images are stored in the file itself or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass that file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, Create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in a double way. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view through the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manual option to copy to the closeness of the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy into the vicinity of the .kim file copying & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most of the pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you still want this, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kin file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Explorer menu... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you have to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category of people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups, and if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) specify the information about your pictures, about (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file which you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and use it again automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, so you can start a different folder tree with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Firma / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will be able to explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, for example people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the dialog box, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window, there is a list of the current category and on the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page, which you can call through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules are shared between multiple applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications put their pictures in albums: here is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also include a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category of people, & kphotoalbum; so do, so whether you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen when you start and photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you can see the menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain much information as you have not yet entered any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you pictures, which will show you an overview with all available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to tag any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image was recorded, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. for example, on all pictures of Jesper, and all pictures recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always be using them again whenever you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons can be mapped, you can find that the names used are moved up to find and assign people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and edit these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the thumbnail and back buttons below the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S.. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can easily drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it one subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that is the upper edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which gives you another option to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. see this procedure in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this is shown here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now, the window that you can see in the picture is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use the images somewhere without you stored on the hard disk. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. for example, pictures 1-9 are visible. for pictures 5-9, however, thumbnails are available, so you can preview these images. you can also not view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy it back. so if you are annoying about how to avoid the jumble singing of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that in the end those you want to make available to others and click Current View on Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see, lock and lock the menu item All except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures to lock, thus eliminating all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all the images on the hard disk and on the other can either read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to forbid those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images by Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer to switch from & kphotoalbum; it is able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image. you can just use the mouse to pull up a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out the zoomt zooming in the middle of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the button key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation key sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos will work in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you might prefer to mark only the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you look one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in you see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, they are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just tag them all at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you display categories in the thumbnail, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the character after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow & kphotoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see a picture on which was painted. to turn on the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; on the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to have the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">You can select single objects in the object tree. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the item and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene with deletion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified Properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you entered invalid values, a message is displayed with a fault description. then, you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; enter user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only one part of the texture (for example a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for displacements. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different layout, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map-map leader at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to redeem a view from the anchoring, drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the fassertion bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the toolbar. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... to save it. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 up to date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon Rendering the icon rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to have a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the box section and enter the image detail to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality Combination field you can select the properties that are used by Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling integrates the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split up again and again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, changing & Povray; the rays are around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the Import Type menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source text for & Povray; also paste.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is rendered. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your document and the version.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene file, you also need to enter the path to these files. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-reception of the points to the grid in the contextual menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects like the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera is using an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When displaying soil, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold values. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window orders section, it explains how to create and store window slots.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Panel Standard Window System: displays all existing window slots. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing windows orders shows all existing window slots. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected array with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with map card you will receive a map map view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start with no more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, you can't use rules for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user button or the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a fader (insert finite body tranaders) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the user button or enter the input key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view also shows the layer, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the standard options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can select how to insert the object. please choose first subitem. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the user button and then call the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color list you expected. here further settings are needed. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose one color each time and change the colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already have this step simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press Enter or the button on Apply), so the sphere has contact with the ground. otherwise, the sphere would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, the sphere will give a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first subitem and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then choose one-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshot and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities for you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen, the renderer shifts hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene is edited pixel for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes have been discarded since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new commands with this option for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color based on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field will appear in the lower right corner. if a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box-up & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the two other short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the shortcuts for each window can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, downloads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still watch the current image. this reduces the delay if you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; when ending the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode, the window is larger than the image, the background will also be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up to display only some of the file types that can display the program as well.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1160">& showfoto; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible. in order to access these settings, you have to select a showfoto in the Settings menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1161">In the area of exposure indicators, you can choose the color indicated when the sub- or overexposure indicator is selected. dexterity should be in contrast to the colors with what you should display. exposure should indicate a bright color and overexposure a dark color.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The main window of & showfoto; has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions to the selected images. you can also find the same page row in the image processing. you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders:</seg>

<seg id="1165">You can check the status of your scanner support on the SANE project page by typing the information you need on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.</seg>
<seg id="1166">A standard scanner can be set on the command line of & skanlite; with the command cannlite -d [device name] in the terminal. if this scanner cannot be opened, or if no standard scanner is specified, then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened.</seg>
<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings contain more detailed options of the driver. & channels; (libksane) does not particularly treat these options.</seg>
<seg id="1169">In order to scan an image, the user can only start a preview can and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In order to better select the image, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire preview into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">If the image is selected, the final image can be read with the scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">If you preview a preview in the settings before saving, the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below. when saving is pressed, the image will be saved and the image will lead to a demolition and you will get back to the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1173">The Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window. you can change the most important settings here.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The user can view the image if desired before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not desired by the user, then the option must be selected.</seg>

<seg id="1177">This parameter defines an image prefix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving. the automatically saved image gets a numeric suffix that is saved each time a picture is saved. the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1178">The user can adjust the image quality used for saving. this value also changes the compression level when saving. if select the image quality is not selected, then the default value of Qt is used.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys to function as & Amarok; short instructions. this will make your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most often found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break could look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the modules needed are available and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly notice that writing scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your script can exchange data with Amarok and steer Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should include any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is mostly used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weists the script to view the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece can be retrieved (for example the metadata or length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume indicates a change in volume. the volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Includes the path to the selected playlist files, when a custom menu entry has been clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleanup work. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with catacscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the rest of the modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts side by & Amarok; for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting Browser and Quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can you never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is the right one for you. and if your decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. in addition, many different audio systems can be used so that THEY can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to relive your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any difficulties in compiling. if you encounter problems, please report it in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies have to be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards for setting up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the playlist, the player window will turn on or off. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. the option turns on the experimental function of the tuner.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Atmospheric design: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. this will change the color scheme used for the tuner barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Drop sound files at the music files: this function is only available when & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored in the location folder of & Amarok; otherwise the .mood files are stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok; should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you want to save playlist playlist, the current playlist will automatically save when you finish & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">In order to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, it causes the playlists to roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing parts to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting custom fonts, the otherwise grey outlined section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlists windows, player windows and context browser. press select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and you can set up your own color scheme. use the color selector, which is activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playback at startup causes & Amarok; after the program start, playback will continue with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection. if Own colors are not enabled, the default & kde colours are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-screen environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output Card board lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate more settings in this card slot.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if you add or delete music files). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists then appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination panel driver: allows you to choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to insert the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card board supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece as needed.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send picked pieces and update the profile: this setting allows you to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshot photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we wrote a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by browsing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because taglib is crashing when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing the Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then you disable automatic shutdown if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into meta-information, but they do not feature as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($ARGV [0]\ 'unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled using this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (default mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) always look active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten. this can be done in the Control Center under Appearance icons. note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol up to three times until it shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: Undefined Symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmaperK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok first finds the correct version.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also look for help from other users or with the developers. use the forum and IRC at irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please only enter a bug there if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively keep the surface intuitively, the start sub-window has been converted into the statistic-window. you can find it under Extras stats.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To review pieces, the playlists must be shown in the playlist. click the & RMBn; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece. you can also use the short instructions on Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press the resolution on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and select from the drop-down menu from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there, just like you would do with other files. it's as easy as that: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the playlist of the playlist, right next to the Add button, you will find the playlist to save playlist. click on it.</seg>

<seg id="1272">When you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a blender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must be decoded first. you can't just listen to an MP3 to ALSA, you would only want a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open the Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable Soundserver with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.X there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. magnifying the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver was heavily optimized for analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts Puffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less idle the visualizations react. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; AB. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After the installation of GStreamer, you have to register all the components. do not carry out registers to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't work, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download timpeg, compile and install it. then run in the module folder from GStreamer all ffmpeg files (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others. the playlists window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current track or current stream. directly below is the area, playing time, bitrate and samplerate of the current play. clicking on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can change through the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the PL and EQ controls are also located. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window while the knob is used for setting equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playback buttons, volume control and play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous track.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ in the player window. once you select the check box equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that don't exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, you find the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the running piece. its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you've already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the sub-window will drop off. the information presented there has now been split into other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music sub-window displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the images may have arbitrary names, but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the suggested pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this section displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. click the right mouse button somewhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text under text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using scripts. if you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is needed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - group only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are left out.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces are arranged by artist and a further division is performed according to the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your tunes will be sorted by genre and by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. critics concerning the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There is a selection field under the search filter that lets you filter out the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time frames, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. furthermore, you can of course select your complete collection, whereby the filter is switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leverages the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach the playlist to playlist - Adding the selected pieces from the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be done next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the Media Player Browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears in various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up the compilation album - Moves a compilation of selected album back to a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again under the respective interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser simply shapes the handling of many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these utilize & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart playlist players are possible. click Smart playlist to open the dialog to Create a New Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for connecting & Amarok; to be connected to your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; start, you will find the pieces on your iPod as performer sorts in the top list view of the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them on the List of Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, exit & Amarok; and release the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL. for example, when you enter: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert drop-down files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop it. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR enter between the search terms, it is searched for entries that either contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found which contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you wish. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50, and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and clicking on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order. entries will then receive a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, magnifiable analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it will open the same menu as that which you can display in the player window through the right mouse button. you can set up the configuration via this menu.</seg>

<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and repeat, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar flag in general settings.</seg>

<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to start burning the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described by the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you merge files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used. it is designed for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only leaves the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, it is not supported by converting / decreasing a DVD with the help of copying dialog, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to clear the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ± R (W), so the content will be completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired instantaneously by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the contents view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and trim of black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is presented in the contents view and includes features of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars from & k3b; When an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is selected, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their content is displayed in the contents view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, lock and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and drag files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the allocation of keys to it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is intended to personalize and adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line or the slightly more comfortable Kdcop program. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task will be crucial to which the accompanying programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you are using the command line dcop. to be able to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then type something like the following to the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createModels CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can obtain a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void tagl (KURL url, QString parent) void addUrls (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void renameItem (QString path, QString newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createData CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Exit for & kde;. with it you can easily record audio CD's; s out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoding who encode these wav files (these encoder packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Become in a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CDs; s: as already said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to break any copy protection; even if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD-device can handle the protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid buying copies protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (but the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), the daily handling for reading a & CD; explained to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb out of the internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step example, you'll find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB will start the CDDB request according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the coding settings in the setup directory - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard. it must be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the coding settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for coding rather than a complete & CD; to read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different cards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, compression and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such 'shorten' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will nevertheless be supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression ratio approximately 11.128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by teenagers, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you really want the absolute highest quality, regardless of the size of the file, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: Tag) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters needed (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs, upload / enter the information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves in the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note: this is meant to be the author). however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; and that's the way neither the artist nor the music business can be inflicted.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval from & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more exactly are looking for source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution, if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined coders. more information about coders is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing an encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole). thereby 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, the write and read real on it, and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine, as it is considered not totally free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each release & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used to compress the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to download the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the / etc / fstab file and an attempt with the entries of the device labels for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map box General Settings. here's not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be as loaded / keyed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select in the case of incomplete information, so that you will be notified when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Map Map CD; settings. simply select both records. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory and file name will be changed with Conqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, if you download the database before. however, this is about 620 MB big, think twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card board.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb servers via the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should get? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this path the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work at the same time as the server is concerned, since many firewalls standardly buck the protocol 8880, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces ending simultaneously: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "throw it out after reading the last piece: check this on to discard the & CD; at the end of the trial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">To enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be left to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to coding at the same time: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we want to pick up data from the freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from that for a & CD; with successful data fetched from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of fetching them from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, then the & CD; into the drive defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look in the questions and answers section after help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all the songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; sets a window, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Play Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual commentary in line with each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: following the successful withdrawal of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; at the most allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that matches the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't give the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover details of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Warning: this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the coding of bit 1 into the format .mp3. this will be read and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (from two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third job is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many variations of settings. best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you quit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the play from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo view and so change the playback speed. to regain the original pace, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, pressing the space bar affects the space bar as pressing the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use textual event, others use lyrics event and again both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set it manually. so if you select the Automatical text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the entries tab or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you hold together. these are played in the series. in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection under the point Organizers. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be saved. keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. again, you can select the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is checked, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Opener or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row after the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, next song from the menu item, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song, select the Previous item, select the Previous item from the menu item, or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map, which converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into the events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making the trumpet sound whenever a piano should be played.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. AWE and GUS charts, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "Name of keymap..." END define keymap "A more keymap... END $CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order, nor leave line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M. for example, if your keyboard doesn't support a shot (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (a gun), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum Patch the Patch is meant, with which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone means pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as is their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to map tones onto the percussion channel. take a look at keymaps that are included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and second channel, make it easy in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for Keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be used. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender-event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you will find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supported & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check the Automatically Add to Collection before setting up. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -Desktop with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; open on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn off setting automatic addition to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.H.. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Add to the collection and open A.mid. Your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this animates me to continue on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; MÃ ¡laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a little time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write to me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really get a big joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will be among friends of & kmid; but if you want to send a MIDI file, you should contact me as soon as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I would like to stress that I'm only about programing because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or just a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Additionaly you can find & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile and kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as to playback DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections from the Bookmarks menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. when you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TVs and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed from the View menu and the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation while starting and ending can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation while starting does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; img dur = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; / smilgt; In the source package of & KMPlayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything has to be configured manually by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how to play a flash'with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be played in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to start in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always take a given jaw for a particular mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, you need to configure the device to use and the TV channels. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port is to be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the code to be used must be found out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). that's why the videoforlinux expansion must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, multiple names are used by KMPlayer. at the time of creating this documentation dvdnsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrresource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any way I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be executed as root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom will be shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to be based on the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components may be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; project includes some already compiled packages of & kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included in the kile; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made via the kile; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions or when compiling & kile; or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; work area. & kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within it a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; in conclusion, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; reference and powerful project management need to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, an avalanche (engl. lay) & latex; -Makros can also be used. a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good knowledge of and neon; given, it is not the ultimate book to do. to be able to control Latex; good books, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dawn for.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-entry wizard from & kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & kile; selecting the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings based on the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document Classes: this sets the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], cover [letter], report [text], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], slides [prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this sets the character coding. it should be used to encode the system. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for proper processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for & latex; for the integration they must be selected only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Report (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of KOMA-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations). you should always find use in preparing German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now don't have to worry about it. it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - as well as other source-text editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile, it is more likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed. however, you have noticed it due to the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will be saved by the highlighting time and the riser.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Automatic execution of the environments is automatically created by typing a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for typing the text) and the associated line to set the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu setting... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, the recovery search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [gerÃ ¤tedependent file] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the current output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing from DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back panel search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked with the editor and once on an element in the DVI; file has been clicked becomes the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is clicked, becomes the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other involved .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & Latex; -Source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is set to the "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the toolbar, the three large selection fields should pop up. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick integration of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; instructions for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other selector box is for inserting items such as keywords, notation notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, a picture or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (choose a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can be written naturally also in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size. you can set the font handles for the main text, the tag notes, etc. the following font sizes are available for insertion:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two options available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] determines the font list. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been typed, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s building or button quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code needs to be saved before compiling. & kile; automatically retrieves storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Failure to compile the document fails, should be sought in the logging according to the errors. if fast construction should be used, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few items should have a different font file. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} suffices then to "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be overclocked within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no limit (number) for the modifications within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a phrase can be displayed in italics with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is presented for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language, now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made to better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few passages in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem should come to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer). an external viewer must close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converting or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as needed for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file is made of the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview searchlight allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & Latex; -binaries. to do this simply set up Modern under Settings... Tools Building are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To run the preview search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and clicked on pre-selection. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer will then take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & kile; in & Eyepiece; set as text editor (Setting Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you fail to open the & DVI interfaces, you can make a mistake. if there is an error, it will be displayed in the log message or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file declares the source code error source. in the editor you can use the Previous LaTeX Errors and Next LaTeX Errors for explosives between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. in order to view the flawed line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kile; jump to the flawed line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Temporary users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created. & kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character coding). these variables can be set up in settings... settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated insertion of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the custom template can then be selected instead of the standard parts.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if a template is simple to create a template, it should be searched for on the Internet and searched for as described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can start directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked by the LaTeX reference. it contains a comprehensive description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; word. this means that the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with twisted switch button, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex differ; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional sprungers. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the quantity Edit Sprungmarken or the corresponding push-button allows the jump to the next or last sprint mark. thereby, this jump mark is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is likely to be one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & kate; already excellent opportunities are added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is always supported & kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Wases, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only predictive thing in & kile; is that the sections are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also & latex; -commands with a back shell (\\) and an additional star (*) will end at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the key shortzel Ctrl; K with which the entire row is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to read the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of Edit extract sales.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further orders under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to make the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jumped at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, it is quick to lose sight of the above-mentioned environment. this command will close the recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure will not be dissipated.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special orders for the & latex; groups determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jumped at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jumped at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the brazen skoby of a & tex; group #, jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested grouped groups clasps it can easily be lost to the above-mentioned group. this command will close the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple add-on symbols are used as seals. for the appropriate implementation, the sign is used in & kile; the sign "is used for two simple reference marks." & kile; knows this case and leads two close-requisites for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic set-up of duplicates can set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in sub-specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French calls. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When printing Shift; Enter Keys & kile; an intelligent line break. in case the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, close the current line with\\\\ with a line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set under Settings kile; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users would like to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all Et signs (amp;) among themselves. & kile; trying to enable this. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not the associated table, add & kile; some space for the columns position of the current table.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offering a good source code completion, it has been extended in & kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are for the automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added by the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to set the complete list accordingly. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed from & kile; also springmarks can be frozen so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing the springbrands NÃ ¤chste springmark and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; set up... kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. there can be different wills for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as vÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher of general language-use are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters entered with\\ begin and the invaded mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, environments are often used that & kile; a special mode for the execution of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the complete set-down mode about the setting of a complete environment or the key, Alt + Shift key, the command for the setting of the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient fulfilment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is complete, the environment will be closed automatically. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings kile; set up... kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of extension for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; Supports custom lists of offsets that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... tile can be set up completely. as an example of a cooling list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word processing mode implemented over the volume of complete cooling or pressing the Ctrl + Alt Empty key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been found that many more languages are written in a document more than once. thus, & kile; the complete satisfaction for all already written victors.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in a set of settings... tile can be deported. here, the threshold for displaying the complete satisfaction can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / native home folder. mode stands for breviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible. to point out the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for modifications and reorders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in groups in the compilation of compiling, creating conversion and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & Eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be converted to a standard viewer by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being asked about the project New Project.... This is where the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet designed endlessly and can still be used in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to support the users.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the coding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the coding of the file can be skipped), but this setting here will be pushed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies so that a power failure or crash during the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own View (or the documentation in a map), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Tree Configuration menu, the visibility of node in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that will unfold when editing. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from third party which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most well-known & conqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin if it is not in a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Reload component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. selecting allows you to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -UI:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or she tells the plugin to listen to debugging needs. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger display.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Assign the debugger to start with the execution of the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debugging has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Assign the debugger to start with the execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a query has been made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next script in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next script in the script, where possible, if possible, it will be corrected in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog box allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and toolbar. tag folders are handy, symbolic-oriented boxes of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document when a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details about conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbar. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag displays. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a typist.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of descriptive language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but the element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class type class. the base class name for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, that means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list together. it can happen only once for an attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">For checking the TagXML files, the Tools Dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; Start window and select TagXML. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be input a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quickstart dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This is the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can accept input from & quantaplus; at default input. in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable normally only makes sense with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, which are sent to the default output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure promotions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use its use, activate the dialog "Edit tag" when available, so that you can enter the action when using it.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel as standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly regarded as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signalized that clicking on this symbol will become a & lt; start; tag in the current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it still needs to be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings Action... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, if there are any ones, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared for a better overview by several separators into several groups. open the toolbar set dialog via Settings toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, how the separator supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar may believe that the & conqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by sampling all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the right folder. after neueXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their file descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) is loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # Elements in the main index top element = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html day1 = tag1.html day2 = tag2.html day3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Beting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used to support context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements which should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docx file in accordance with $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you have specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places, you can send an email menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, ship toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other & quantaplus users can download them. the posts are checked and only made available when our team considers them as correct and useful for publishing. in order to make a full contribution we recommend to sign the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private gPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool bar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. in case of problems it is warning and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in everyday XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionsheader: the string that appears in the! doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion to & descriptionrc; editor to be adjusted with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these concepts and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one has to familiarise oneself with these fundamental concepts first. this chapter seeks to introduce these concepts closely without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; from toolbars to actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that only those users can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card holders with information and toolbars. please check in and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all cards, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, skipping to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area lead to another context menu concerning the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags on the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string is named a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bars is displayed. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; paste in your document, click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can enter the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a day that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction managers (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with boards for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation baumanviews are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows the files to be managed in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates can only be used for the respective users and templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can download the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands pertaining to navigation and refresher of the tree will open.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, many attributes and namespaces can change. the infeed system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cards at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This trader shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This trader shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -Scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command indicated. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am folder. also, you should make sure this is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers started from & quantaplus; to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup-language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of Why evolving what has someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; framework, it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more detailed documentation, help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & conqueror; type, or run helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, taking out the oldest record.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML in insertion from the clipboard, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes straight to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window where you see the display of script sections and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">On and off the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries prediction or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files to the server in your project. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from time to time you downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved using settings... added. toolbars are stored by toolbar toolbars, or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">You can send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE directory, the loading will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu item in the menu item that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar refusal if this day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above mentioned menu items. clicking on it activates it. clicking on an activated plug-in will disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the item; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the current document's syntax using the selected & DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the changeover sometimes may require time or unnice graphics. recommended is the map sheet mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Align the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars, or which add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, as the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project, e.g. after filling the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension of webprj (foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you handle local data. either a name (hostname.ex.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setup, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars as standard. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in case of server execution (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Get haked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be incorporated. if a project is started from scratch, don't hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the hook, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the subwindow profiles or with the Shift key Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the Options button. in PHost, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing out its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions will be executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can't be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the Project or the icon Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, however the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is more than one profile, the button is deflected to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Remember that the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk save this option.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply dipping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible via Settings tool bar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to boost productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars are in & quantaplus; the best way to create tool bars on the tool bar. use and add. the addition of tool bars is treated at the bottom in the addition of tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action can be created, a new toolbar can be created, the toolbar can be renamed or toolbars can be executed, indicating which actions should be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set Settings actions.. specify.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code schnitzel and files to link. & quantaplus; templates basically use like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or associate each of the existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one imagines for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms introduced at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template tree with global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. normally, special documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can contain everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project file) the template will not be visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with dragging and placing on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as dragging and dragging, or inserting across the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create site template, secure a name for the template and secure it. by default, it will be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can create headers and footers or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert or associate files with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is deflected as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default, and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-building block. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to file a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying contents templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) via a full command collection for adding folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source text editor through the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode functions just like the first one, except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor in sync with the source code editor and in the VPL; in this mode, this mode is active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is configurable via Settings Quanta.... When choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatic. in the selection automatically the time span can be set. basically, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast computers and a large gap for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">If you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties. this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, for example, keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows you to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in word processing, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via toolbars, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the table wizard or Listen-Assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists have to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style template design can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile successfully, you don't need & kde; the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml which are already present at a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2275">Multiple commands may require more than one argument. quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a holding point is set in a file called "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed much lyrics in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what was changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merging is also fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you comparing and merge the complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently have to check cocodes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Ord1 Orner2 kdiff3 ordner1 folder 2 -o Destfolder cdiff3 folder 1 folder folder folder folder folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows you to manually type filenames, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog keeps track of your selection and will display it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the Compare or merge folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then & kdiff3; the filename of A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify a output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in the Open dialog, you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you cannot withdraw anything from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text into a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will indicate the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees the color of which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the abstracts column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line will be scored on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [change] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Button Springe to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the window, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by editing; then in those lines the text & lt; No line in the queue; shown. this is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear either in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the options when selecting the sources, Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page from, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are used by other programs. the Oversight column next to the vertical image strip can also be used for navigating.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auction window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. by Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upstream / Ctrl-picture downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). it also gives the option Selection automatically. however, if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and manual copying is deleted. be careful with this option, because you may overwrite the contents of clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use jack-back + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line-ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you are finished and restored to the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; Button Default...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered scanned. on these systems, the default settings automatically create an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard, then manually copy to the clipboard then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all the identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a sprint character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others may look identical with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison although they are different. when this option is checked, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' -' 9 ','. ',' - ') are ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated by default. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is further injected.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts resulting from the merge menu. note that the Automatic Selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need & kdiff3; exit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character here.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8 bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C, next to the normal one, a second overt column is displayed with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just leave out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the recently used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to that external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out bothersome parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When you read a file, it is first passed to that external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for newline commands to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression of the text found on each string. the\\ 1 in the original string refers to the found text in the first clammernpair. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a pre-processing command for line spacers is required. you can change the list as needed. the\\ in front of the $is necessary because $is a special character and would mean the end of the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line levelling. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any matches will be replaced by nothing, so almost extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several translations at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / PRESS / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will display the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without actually doing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files that were until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories and fold up all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparative window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors of red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Synchronize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronize dirs. then & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B; directly copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging (unsure), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and the same date will show error: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge a file will be processed after the other. status column shows skill, if merging was successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is right anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the file comparision method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, you will be used in the Three-Folder merge mode C as a target, B will be chosen as target for two-folder merge, and B and / or B will be used for synchronization.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to merge only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box with the options will pop-up, simulate and cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you only want to see what would happen without making any real changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, restart / continue directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; crashes on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge the merge (F7 key), you have the possibility to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; those entries (in the current session) will not merge them again in later compilation of all entries. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The & kdiff3 Settings menu; (Set Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignoring files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the major advantage is that this can be set specific to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous dot marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; do not lead to possible recessions.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files across a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed benefit will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no true comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. for example, this may be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copying of the more recent file is suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe, because it assumes the knowledge that the other file was not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original If an old backup file exists with the .original extension, it will also be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the folder & text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the folder will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, whitesp- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or you can't distinguish if a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, permissions or change date deviate from the original. (note the option Trust of Size.) (This is only possible in local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference-viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference-viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the difference-viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; that the input file is a patch file in the unified format. then & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select a CDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small tool bar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part Mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL softwares for a long time and have learned a lot by peeling into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, it suddenly stops; No src has been released; the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of recent changes, see http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must re-read the folder with the update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also causes identical files to not be copied when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the labels A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved inside & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries to set up pager... and add the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and end.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved inside the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop, and can also be moved to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is selected, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Checking this field leaves the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1st work area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is selected, the background of each working area will also be displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is selected, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the layout of the & Kpager; the main window can be determined: classic leaves & pagers; in a 2xN grid, all virtual desktops are displayed in a horizontal and vertical groove in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with its contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign value to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor remains on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury syndrome) and that every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor remains on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and that every mouse click emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer can also be caused by a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you briefly interrupt the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click takes out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligible sliding is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it leaves the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements will be started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the standby after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing to do is use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later use the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which positions one mouse click does not have any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted responses. you can therefore parken the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape off with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if an imposition has just started. if you are using the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can even click a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor exactly where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidentally moving mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to select text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, some advice is needed here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select text as follows: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will whenever & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. thus, you know exactly when the shifting time begins when it moves smart. later, you can use the smart move also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor falls short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and those that cause pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time that a pull process starts before the mouse button is released. in this way, pulling and dragging with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for worterers. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can offset the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word processor.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keystrokes of your phrases (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">When you have made a mouth, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is attached to the trajectory. you can select from it sets which are to be re-spoken.</seg>

<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or associated key shortcut. if you have selected a textbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions such as new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting in the menu bar, in the toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="2595">If you click on the Map Passenger Speaker in ttsmgr the board chart will be displayed. this will also appear automatically when you start kttsmgr and no speaker has yet been set up.</seg>
<seg id="2596">All speakers already set up appear in this list. the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list. the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2597">With a mouse click, select a speaker from the list, and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2598">With a mouse click, select a speaker from the list, and click on this button to change the settings. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Select a speaker from the list with a mouse click, and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down. the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current & standby; system.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Choose a type of voice, there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2602">If you click here, the new speaker will appear on the Map File Speaker. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Now you can & ktts; almost use it. go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled (KTTSD) to start. see. now you can & ktts; use to read text. click on the Map File to create and manage text orders. see.</seg>
<seg id="2604">If you have at least one speaker set up, you can start the & kde language training system. click on the General map Leaders to open this map. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Select this check box to enable the & ktts; -system. this starts the KDE-TTS service (KTTSD). if this start is successful, the map file will be displayed and you can create text jobs and read the TTS system from & kde; deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2606">If ttsmgr is finished, running & ktts; next, provided the field voice output is enabled (KTTSD) is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2607">If this check box is selected and ttsmgr identifies automatically in the system area of the control bar, it disappears again as soon as the pre-reading is complete.</seg>
<seg id="2608">Using the buttons in this series, you can start, stop, pause and resume text assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2609">With the buttons in this series, you can read the current text in the & kde; clipboard or open a text file for reading. you can also change the speaker for an order.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Click Apply or OK, then all changed settings will be taken on all pages.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The card pass orders will only be displayed when KTTSD is started. to start KTTSD, click on the Map-map Leading General and check the voice output there (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the web browser of & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed web page. then check the text that should be read, and select the text in the main menu. after a short time, the voice output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page. you can skip this step, but then many & HTML; pre-tensioning lines and other invisible marks are also read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & kate; the extended text editor of & kde;, you can read the text displayed. then check the text that should be read, and select the text to read in the main menu. then, the voice output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works when & kate; embedded in other applications like & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">KNotify is the message system of & kde; that notifies you about events that you have set up. you can read the text of these messages from & kton; read.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & kde;, you can set up various types of messages. for example, you can set & conversation; for example, set up a message in an IRC channel where your Nickname occurs. with & ktts; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Support a & kde; -program KNotify, a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml which is part of the delivery of & ktts; is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the printout / local / inbox, since it can be assumed in most cases as presumed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & kton; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech patch program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace wrongly spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the speech-disk program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read, you can start with & kmouth; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any job you initiate from the card pass is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text assignments are meant for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen readers, while & ktts; just one such read, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reavers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String placers replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can either be specified as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with pre-defined string set filters, which allow the creation of chat emmoticons such as: -) by text or for the format of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a more comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE messages on it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text application, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further down installation dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison template to set up character set-up filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to be distinguished by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl; key pressed at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 indicates, you can only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string substitution filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Diesen Filter apply if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string substitution filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by separator signs.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs and # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the board card, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; passes a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the Speaker is selected based on the Speaker's characteristics that the program sends the text to & ktts; sends, and overwrite the characteristics of the Speaker set on the board card.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions, you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the Speaker Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, from & kde;, can give programmers their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; -interface of the voice output API by & kde;. see the full documentation for both APIs on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Reform filter, but when using the module for festival websites are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta you have to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone so that SABLE works at all. you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS operates with any voice synthesizer, which can be run on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, drag the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the kton website; for information, which are not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">Speech-Dispatcher uses a adaptable modul architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktert; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; but is not necessarily required. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispenser."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdeaccessibility or downloaded the tarball that is currently created every night, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using a speech synthesizer, check first whether speech-dispatcher works properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech-disk; the program kttmsgr needs to be developed in such a way that the installation of speech-dispatcher is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can go back sentence or paragraph, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application delivers text to & ktts, it can provide the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it is automatically the best matching speaker. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; choose a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the Map File Speaker to add, and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the Map Map Printer Setup is displayed. as an example, the module of the Module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details of the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text given to the festival. if voices, the & ktts are known, this setting is automatically made. generally speaking, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, using eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliding controls, you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and display this grey, the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so the first set will be synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you don't have to set up a speaker yet (or forget to click on the user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of ttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol ttsmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ttsmgr is not running, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the job, the number of sentences and the precisely edited sentence. the narrator ID corresponds to the column ID on the Map Map Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can proceed as a substitute in the order that is selected in the list below, forward or backward. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) will be taken over and ttsmgr will be scaled down to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the audio menu audio.</seg>

<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, & ktts; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or & ktts; can not load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If you want to use GStreamer or aKode for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you chose ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200 free;% about double normal speaking speed. to allow these settings to be converted, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the running & kton; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you have to find out which device works with you. in case of doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special promotions that are always executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you do & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen readers, add & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is played whenever a normal text assignment is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map pass are only valid for normal text assignments. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and screen reavers if they are interrupted by a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; KNotify messages, start kttsmgr and click on alerts. the map file will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable & kde preferences; if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, alerts where a sound is played will be deleted by & ktert; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is stated in the list will be ignored by & kton.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selector to specify what & ktts; to do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you selected text pre-read, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want. standard chooses the speaker that is shown in the list on the board of speakers as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is defined for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as a final option, the action will be carried by default (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All notifications for the application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list). for this, you can specify the notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications in a file. use the button Load to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard includes marks for controlling voice, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male), since this is the default voice that the festival uses when issuing SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype Spear PUBLIC "- / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / synis.dtd" &gt; Who slept in my bed? asked the bear child.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters (SDB filter). thus, & ktts subdivide text into individual sentences. this means that only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limits detection filters. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit identifier is set up as the default. you can change its settings or add further set-line recognition filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get started is to select the speaker selection. turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read. switch on the box map to which speaker & ktam; switch off the speaker selection, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then begin faster with the reading, as only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card pass, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit identifiers compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator character (decimalcode 8) at the set limits (tab characters are removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set limit identifier maintains the character setting.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), alerts, messages or output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit password filter, you can insert it again by loading the default _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The Map File Speaker Selection allows you to overwrite the Speaker Settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the board card speaker). in other words: no choral features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the characteristics of a set speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, choose & ktert; otherwise choose & ktert; the speaker that is most likely to meet the initial set of features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is mainly when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the Speaker field, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker button and then use the speaker, which is most likely to match the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the final text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr precipitates immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; has been completed. probably you have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x, the command will be wired-registry-0.8. if the problem is not resolved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer may be installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I stop receiving a text, freezes & ktts; a message on the & console; appears: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA which prevent simultaneously opening multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in the festival, but ttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. as a guide you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio board audio, there is an adjustment speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker devices. depending on the selected voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Disenable either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML converter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS Synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch with & kton.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice continues to presuppose festival 1.95 beta or new. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / Voices / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding like KOI8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the coding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic like KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates voice from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. txt2pho can also produce the required diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German text diphone.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by choosing K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other & knetworkconf settings; create a simple interface for the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in & kcontrolcenter; the network setup module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured, thus & knetworkconf, which displays the device at all and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux; if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index. when starting the network setup, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which matches the distribution and release level. selecting non-recurring settings can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will then be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed in grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter the system administrator mode at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system administration mode, divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are retrieved from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting can be selected. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. the net mask must be specified in the net mask input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the device's properties in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or switched off, depending on your needs. activating a switched off network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be enabled or switched off, depending on your needs. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and activating the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If more than one network interface is present on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support substitutes a full domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name to an IP address like about 123.45,678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator's name resolution calculator allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records may be rearranged by selecting an entry or grading in the list with buttons Hinds or downs in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... it will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of particular hosts describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily on boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks it is possible to replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains unknown hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known machine and click Add... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an especially well-known machine from the list and select Edit.... Creating the dialog known machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module's network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool for its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf may be discussed; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely distributed. IPv6 is expected to enforce it in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg, the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used, and the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified dynamically with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the Scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the base of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on one tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which beyond the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the tape and reads the prestressing information of the band. detects & kdat; don't know the preload on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the pretension, it searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the band can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration need to be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not match formatting with & kdat;. if your tape drive assumes that a volume needs to be formatted prior to use, this must happen before you are formatted by the band of & kdat. floppy tape drives usually require a formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Restore menu....</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the band's content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can recreate the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup job:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the folder currently selected.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, it is true that only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other filesystems, you can enter into backup files separately. every entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the Buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is incorporated, the command will load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; block the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, & kdat; the hardware side block size for the tape drive is to be changed. not all drives support variable block sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the complete name of the system on which the band is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this icon is only active when a tape is incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users allow quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users give rapid access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely you do not have access to system administrator privileges. under Linux, the protocol files normally do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set strings. in addition, the list of the log lines will be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the column process. in addition, in the protocol file, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. level errors of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as a protocol-line of the level indication. the colored display of protocol rows can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the sync protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu, in order to let all new incoming protocol lines appear.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; lets you display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There will be more up-to-date information about the sources of reference from & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following directory of the & kde; -Subversion-archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and also named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly develops into a standard for the control of program start-up when booting the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; Kernel looks first in / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init also differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder named rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port at boot time.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have done something, then you can repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; in addition I could also have a user runlevel, the & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. thus, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it to the Insert -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorption number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sort number of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with paste (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sort number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for runlevel X execution, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) use, you have to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled extended system settings. only when you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users will create a map card that allows you to customize individual settings. other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map file only appears if there is space restriction (quota.user / quota.group on the file system if required) and is initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group of cards informs about the group belonging functions of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Library field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot from the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
