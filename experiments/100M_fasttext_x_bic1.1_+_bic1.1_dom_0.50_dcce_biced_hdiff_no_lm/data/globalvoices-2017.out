although I had visited the USA at least once a year , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily large .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the United States only strengthened .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never holds his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever achieved by the nomin@@ ee nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ et Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ ump int@@ oler@@ ance is also in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for a long time , and to her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump ste@@ amed his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congreg@@ ations are not taken into account .
could it be that those vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments on the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( picture of the white against all other ethnic groups , &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash based on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones claimed , has killed exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always , America means everyone welcome .
for this land chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a vast majority of the white American saying this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a common ?
that the music that is played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence .
but this changed following a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , french horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located at the top of the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ produced instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recycl@@ ers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire encomp@@ asses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made out of apost@@ asy .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from re@@ produced material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est , like the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ ft@@ ly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to esc@@ ort one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , launched in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who at that time had distributed the Premier from their waters .
&quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate violation of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail pace , with which information was circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions today happen in real time , with trace@@ able to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . such susp@@ icious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is loading his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm who advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i loose each year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal f@@ ishers .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , indicating imagin@@ ative species , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; they deliberately utilize the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You are not allowed to attack my port . &apos;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i now .
until now , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 tests of susp@@ icious ships .
it revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency to combat crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help FISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that are willing to hide .
&quot; the illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . it should help FISH @-@ i to find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
but FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and by which the position of each tracking vessel can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ecting criminals , but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that were f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
when FISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow @-@ nets on board , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the aim of bringing even more such initiatives and structures to other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently FISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used to@@ wing nets that are now banned .
the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; Ber@@ gh says .
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative work method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of the referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were running , re@@ acted by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reimbur@@ sement of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against it can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the areas of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of the Federal Parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new governance alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on October 27th . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national Civil Defence and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; The Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;

Twitter pil@@ es images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a have no skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic introduces the round , which forms the level of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs includes :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your inaugur@@ ation !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has done little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis and pre@@ fers to keep critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the Mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adap@@ ting version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in Cór@@ doba , Argentina .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , it is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tort@@ urer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of intelligence division 141 in La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testi@@ fied of a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve enjoyed yourself with one of the ERP .
passport just that they don &apos;t run you one day and then I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolution@@ ary Workers Party .
a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become en@@ vy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tort@@ ured . &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a tiny bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were put down and held me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pe@@ aked in and saw a couch that men were tort@@ ured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was confined there .
they seldom bound a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it out with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there inside was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty di@@ aper .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing down with their faces - all were tied to hands and feet .
people stood still on the matt@@ resses near the entrance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survi@@ vors , the Civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the path where the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came up from above that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military det@@ achment , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war gain but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal your cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , hit me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and change you self @-@ imposed .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like this .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense of me accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they could burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but what would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear for ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but of course anything remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why the exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I posted the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .

the verdi@@ cts in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in the Spanish .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August , between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 of the op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .

all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now directed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto a &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;

the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
revision of the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , last month witness a particularly mis@@ successful translation .
the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fal@@ sely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
revision of the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could this translate into such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , even gramm@@ atically not entirely correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger informed about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that older people felt ins@@ ul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dis@@ continued with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved nation@@ wide in accidents are quite a cause of concern .
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens triggered 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors rose during the same period .
the un@@ named rep@@ orter brought comments to the light published in Yahoo &apos;s version of the article , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation error received among others the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this not the reality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may be due to lacking understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ jumping or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , nevertheless make translations available internally . then the Japanese staff , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translation can be expected .
the Kyoto city hopefully uses a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet pages of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels also transferred photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cut , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net with no cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates their sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests for specific domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ locked channel , the broadcast was closed on Thursday , 6 April when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who recorded the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of structural .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned here , however , is that the children have to afford countless days of house@@ work which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family , who , in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was a member of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ woh@@ ner@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the deeply rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; can be found in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be a trend @-@ setting case - when for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to en@@ roll bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and started to sell swe@@ ets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours .
she had to share the time so that her time was still learning .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , cleaning the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make supp@@ er for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was forced to stand beside him and read editorial articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he considered it intellig@@ ently , but did not stay with it . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would return home again to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
her masters feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled her to lose again , she explains .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the writers switched to the ad once more :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
throughout our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early History of Paraguay , who were ens@@ la@@ ved to the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors land in Paraguay ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , where they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty @-@ six Egyptian MPs have recently agreed on a bill to &quot; Reg@@ ul@@ atory Reg@@ ulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
when accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring with it a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a cash bu@@ ckle .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall blocked by Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level for Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Tech@@ nolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; conducting research technolog@@ ist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring it into a court process .
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated at the parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those en@@ vis@@ aged that will be found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natural prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big carni@@ v@@ ore is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . therefore , when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple @-@ catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
to this end , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , and only because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been made six years later to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction agency as well as survey results of the concerned themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) were finished in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from housing meetings ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ca@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) settle into final replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the triple @-@ catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of those evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of those evacu@@ ated after disaster were settled into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 1,0@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have re@@ opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely been affected by the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is also lag@@ ging behind here as well .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it more difficult to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to this article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the local population .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still hasn &apos;t been done enough in disaster prevention .
as it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ation .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23@@ ,000 people had been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement buildings .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their homeland pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people are still in temporary shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we &apos;re looking at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we discuss topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone above speech and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nation@@ wide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ ana with a head@@ stock . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of G@@ oi@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures too , the police officer &apos;s face was seen , which attacked a whi@@ p . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ ás admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in G@@ oi@@ ana with his whi@@ p on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit his face would be visible six months on TV and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police brut@@ ality . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás :
G@@ oi@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occ@@ up@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , a squ@@ at@@ ted school was sabot@@ aged with a gas le@@ ak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a police officer who struck him with a whi@@ p .
police ra@@ ps
G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil where it came to brutal police missions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
at protests in the center of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , polic@@ emen set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announ@@ cements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers across the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window @-@ window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported on a broken glass window in order to make their title pages illu@@ stra@@ tive with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window record than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the Ent@@ indu@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ y@@ nos@@ o hundreds of sugar cane factories joined the doors in Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who runs every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again because they were received .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene reminds you that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar price rose some decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agri@@ cultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly come into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , got their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all those ques@@ tioned are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closure year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ s@@ sat and date .
everyone was signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of those present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted by grinding only highly .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather than they began to call it off , they stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a prospects for the future , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , the production of which is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follo@@ wer person , yet he does not deny the lies they told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because he is lacking in strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The North@@ Star .
the workshop thus shows that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confron@@ tation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the district of the Kit@@ esch@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ tears , &quot; a road section in West Can@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
most cases have not been solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ es@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people didn &apos;t always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth
so they can do what the Creator dict@@ ates to .
in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to Sil@@ en@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , close to the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any dish served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of small businesses producing just those plastic dishes that German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into con@@ spic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic rub@@ bing decorated mobile tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into che@@ es@@ y collection objects , such as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complicated .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic .
some Handy @-@ stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ch@@ ura and salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand @-@ made straps made of dried salmon .
additional sk@@ ur@@ ish plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # ori@@ os ( s ) real estate promotion of the # 30 Special Occ@@ up@@ ation posts .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi District , devoted to supplying the restaurant industry . such as the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fri@@ ghtened life changes &quot; ) relates precisely these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta says : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay her out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get those ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories written by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from the files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different in doing so or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbour resort are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t move and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business by month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ des . this corresponds to the average rate of 8,5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tort@@ ured the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or declar@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a horri@@ ble accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its inc@@ eption , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample me@@ tic@@ ulous coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses wrapped up including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the football world championship .
houses contaminated and char@@ tered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photo was examined several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses testi@@ fied dramatically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
even one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange was also associated with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following relate to those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claiming that Myanmar &apos;s President Th@@ ein Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also mistakenly attribute Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not related the image from DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found among 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private pages , platforms of social media and collaborative as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have limited examples of impro@@ per use and are associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases which can now be completely detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false copy of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the now released news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in the context of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre by 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture has been weather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages connected with it have not been taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the emb@@ assy in which the image was from DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Pad@@ re Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( in grey ) Tin@@ Eye will also point out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web cra@@ wler and occasionally have image file names linked to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image will ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts , the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally take part in dro@@ pping the water around a tragedy .
suggests this sen@@ timent of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and it makes the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regards to violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
tech@@ n@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can be used by the context or in a completely ab@@ usive way .
however , every investigation of false write @-@ ups should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo created by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are necessary in order to precisely understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the vanity language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of how to care for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite items here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ ay@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu ob@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the Emer@@ gency Centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing for the flo@@ ods and mud @-@ av@@ alan@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos show an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
tap water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flo@@ ods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five will be completed to transport emergency deliveries for the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me conducted a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded free to the Sri R@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also included a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people who came up with flo@@ ods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in safety and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usage allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girl@@ friend in January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we chant rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; built up in their imagination .
they were killing me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are Muslim .
to be Muslim
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
to be in peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the Western concept the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to control them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I saw these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US did not even choose its first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead movements for change .
it looks over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has st@@ aff@@ ed our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ w@@ lessly that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narrative that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , who come from 77 countries .
the parents of the 1976 writer in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had re@@ thought out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly Muslim and American .
but am I now the Muslim and an American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket jar that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all bags with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than a stranger that tears the head of a woman .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ liest forms att@@ ests to our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms , and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verse to the protection that seals the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon contest in Kar@@ achi , is pos@@ ing with her sisters in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how they could win a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see in that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete pictures painted Su@@ fi Hei@@ liger ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Me , which means God , my only Lord .
for a people who - over centuries - has been colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; created by a company called Ven@@ erable British East @-@ East Company , has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father wept .
in between , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly cried for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have lived &quot; colonial &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was designated as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim strain of 1,7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across each continent from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy enters the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history four times more is reported than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black servant .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , with multiple c@@ ashes , but fails to communicate it to others .
the Nar@@ ra@@ tiv of 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube of sor@@ cer@@ ers , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and to all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build upon this duality structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ atures that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from precisely the countries it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List , &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we are leading and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at North@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations We Ne@@ ed to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ ing to ab@@ ject the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous image printed in our news articles .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group which has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was un@@ aware of when I was as old as it was now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a sandwich in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity puts forth , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public image four decades ago was the scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of the &quot; others &quot; to soli@@ di@@ fy , just as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , while he already bombs broken countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass extin@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
while &quot; listening to these events is often associated with understanding , &quot; these events should instead be &quot; listening in order to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain their story in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience can be listened to .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this tour the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ amus@@ ara tells the tale of Has@@ en and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish the sovereign debt
with the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico , which are up to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was declared by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Front for the No@@ ise Testing of D@@ ebt ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their call :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies who are responsible for the debt will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debts , with fixed , working conditions corresponding to the benefit of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the United States &apos; sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed from outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; in three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of ess@@ ays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real cost with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to make some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ Pris@@ on , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; Colle@@ ctive Memory &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police bass was based on a command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technolog@@ ist and at the moment the conductor of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the cultural prot@@ otyp@@ ical prototypes was more fores@@ ighted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct Pal@@ my@@ ra &apos;s ancient ruins .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ eological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here blend gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began his work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ Ex but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el hasn &apos;t been able to finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book by Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens on every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the j@@ ails of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year passed , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
the history of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tort@@ ured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : post @-@ release director sentenced to previous post on account of corruption
Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , on account of em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800@@ ,000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds at Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s airports , whose advice was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who rejected the request , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to res@@ ume his old post , as the company did not conduct any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our judicial system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contra@@ di@@ cts .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it served .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inf@@ lict damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is f@@ ond of paying for his silence .
contradic@@ tory to me !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no mor@@ ale :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him and I can &apos;t believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely ins@@ ul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks morality and serve the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself had become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded so much .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is imprisoned :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a keen , inc@@ is@@ ive and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is simultaneously criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he was sitting for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he is making money , puts it under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Import items ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo of the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Moz@@ ambi@@ que :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users
the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or cra@@ ck@@ pe@@ as .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
although there is still a discussion about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective , &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use were cens@@ ored .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( gap ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a rather good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the campaign may send a strong signal to all those who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts by telling his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... as I became aware of this new Facebook gui@@ del@@ ine , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but that &apos;s not how it works .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they discovered that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook @-@ automated cens@@ or@@ ship has caused a lot of sc@@ ott among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language , but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then you cure people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , Hass@@ an in social networks is said to inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar in addition to Rak@@ h@@ ine , where cl@@ ashes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prot@@ ra@@ cted hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at context rather than code focused initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is close to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law pro@@ hibit@@ ing this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere with the fact that age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner for the UN Child Rights Convention that defines min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements endeav@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on the to@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader Z. B. had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition meant tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would have made him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
after it has been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws of child@@ birth had finally been am@@ ended .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who held a minist@@ erial post at the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the marriage of children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly talked about the importance of adop@@ ting the law , noted :
the marriage @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the proposal for am@@ ending the marriage network was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ like shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to have made his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users desired that the debate would approach the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so univers@@ ally , in a way that can only invite panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters from it , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they under@@ line .

on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor announced Y@@ ar@@ News to the local news service that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking its popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many Internet users are used to using tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now appearing .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set out everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least check out all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is merely scre@@ en@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site by Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as collabor@@ ators at Moz@@ illa &apos;s Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
one att@@ aches to another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ h@@ len@@ des N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
the motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just returned home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood face @-@ face to Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he sits right away , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for del@@ &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for fo@@ stering Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodation .
have a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should desp@@ ise the norm , get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of their wives also not to mention the name is also widespread among men . however , they have to fear far less assignments if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices such as Children &apos;s He@@ yal up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts this club .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not saying lou@@ dly the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they have du@@ elessly uph@@ eld and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not observe this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband ling@@ ered for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands about their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only gig@@ gled in front of him during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that at home they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the vermi@@ lion dot on the forehead that indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why just need women to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the vermi@@ lion dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for many years now and yet I have never spoken so hon@@ estly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have worn only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pants , wearing ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will do it .
on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed a little , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the fil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a Memorial Day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been enough to make the Japanese go through .
people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were here 51 years ago in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
songs from the Beat@@ les are also sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are connected with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes be not whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated .
right now in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fans in the market , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot; today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen N@@ ood@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day will go .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que target of attacks .

a new system of ab@@ duction of bald people for organ trading , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border with Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they had conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , declared the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission accomplished by the UN 2016 in the South African country to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que after Mos@@ ambi@@ que are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police warned according to the latest mur@@ ders of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M thinks that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que in stri@@ fe ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in the head power to create the riches .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I M@@ Ö@@ GH@@ TS MO@@ DER@@ N A MO@@ SAM@@ IC@@ K , THE SI@@ CH is ashamed of a country in which the people would be ashamed to ask for good grades , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or gl@@ atz@@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are being hun@@ ted , which aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for fla@@ w@@ less hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que authorities are very worried about the murder of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who claimed to be insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but gave no further information .
the residence and constitution were unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay tribute to the creation of b@@ asset as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , so the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans came to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .

this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of the hospital .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says that he considers it &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China is still gaining views from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government told that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations only continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to collect his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for release of Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
us - USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
speaking in the US emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the AF@@ P news agency announced on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the call for the US Embassy has drawn a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and un@@ answer@@ able comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with the fact that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical care of the choice they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany &#124; Germany
German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the bu@@ zz around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide a proper medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um keeps on telling :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those per@@ ished for the exercise of these rights .
France , France
in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s foreign ministry called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan Book Taiwan
the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu in the ruling Democratic Progres@@ sive Party also called on China to allow the ill intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned in a statement on June 28 and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish , since Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of which he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as we reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up again from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the dist@@ orted logic , since they are better suited to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam replies to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really no answers .
he pointed out corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
as An@@ on publ@@ ishes his commentary on the blog , he points out the cri@@ tiques that you should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the co@@ dex .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ balanced even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes he is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
has Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam perpet@@ u@@ ated a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must our Prime Minister pay ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , tends to be a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world un@@ covered and another fac@@ et to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer then . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication generally follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook internally in anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t b@@ other me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all the Can@@ adi@@ ans love .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began traveling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there is no weapon with us !
same sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if you would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being sp@@ it - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ tail ) .
if Canada was really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn attention .
it can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk to the neighbors over the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a Pop band in Thailand released a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations his girl@@ friend is doing .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a huge success .
in the first three days , the video posted on Facebook was divided 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 list@@ ings .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution given to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change in employment &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed as critics by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above illustrates the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors and super@@ vis@@ es online content and prosec@@ uted people who accused the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict mind@@ set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ outs .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed more than 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ic war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ch@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together towards Soviet leaders in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mostly Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Khr@@ us@@ ch@@ kov@@ sky , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty people live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ us@@ h@@ chat@@ kas that house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take a photograph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ sia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very anxi@@ ous situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts behind him .
he plays with the ball that then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones at the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which are responsible for in@@ war@@ dness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about 2,50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits you as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move nor@@ th@@ wards .
the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a building worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Championship .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send her messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and its family have included immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others cannot help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are coming from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to ext@@ ort money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travelers will quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she feeds on her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad@@ ly while she introduces her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat it every time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in Western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone alert , in which it promp@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private We@@ Chat group had been replaced .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ W@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is to block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often impose extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the Twitter based media outlet &quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checking out whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by a rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council of the Party to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , government agencies and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; from local police until 1 August .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; video . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and see that you are all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually been dissolved and revealing a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all glory to their name .
one that has desc@@ ended into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is turning on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone erected around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service put it in place - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds .
it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were alli@@ ed to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid it up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel G@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel G@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust me to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped seeing you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word from what I said .
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence lies in my nose until today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months .
I scre@@ amed the court .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I enter the room .
differently than usual , they probably have allocated me a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and can immediately set me up without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , feeling like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ orted to an old @-@ tried communication method : strike with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was an &quot; first resp@@ ite . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay in a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness no distinctive features can be recognized , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ elled by the fruits in the garden of my head .
from af@@ ar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es sound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th s@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated . &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their view of the world .
this is not a house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , not@@ with@@ standing the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this Ta@@ ge@@ dian and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the l@@ acks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t keep your scre@@ ams back .
my scre@@ ams did not suff@@ ice to him yet , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and did not find any favour , which is why he attacked an electrically charged rod as the next one .
stream flo@@ wed all my body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes even to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all of these themes are relevant not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by limitations , and according to his own statement he can feel with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he h@@ ates a special upgrade against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refuge of the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lu@@ gs of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries .
hence , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry has cancelled the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contra@@ di@@ cts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled &quot; precisely &quot; because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m that constitutes the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; stand up &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ all@@ ising reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew back traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tre@@ bled unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to support Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure in order to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the crime of crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; in@@ definite times be kept in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the warranty on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is also very popular and is well @-@ known for not to shy away from issues that have long t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he can &apos;t separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and freedom of expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been taught me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the nucle@@ us can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ ei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note that his comments were torn , dist@@ orted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a worked version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly advoc@@ ates the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the 8th century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the teachers &apos; association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically critic@@ ised the problems inherent in the country &apos;s deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs show is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster mun@@ itions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced democra@@ cies .
until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ p dol@@ ls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas To@@ ho@@ cus in August . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years ago , in which armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , hosted a two month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( wör@@ th ) .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ ts are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high solid car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appar@@ itions and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can reproduce these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ ser art instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year commen@@ ced in March and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel pushed out to accommodate aff@@ ection ?
this was precisely the question of the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación campaign ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : Revolution@@ ary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bi@@ an@@ ists , however , there is a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ ämp@@ fer , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed war rh@@ et@@ oric and had their arms round the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share in this year his love with people who urgently needed ac@@ claim .
thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience like this :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a le@@ thal weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has never written something so beautiful in my life , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly and sat down beside the gr@@ en@@ ade @-@ thro@@ wer .
perhaps he too was tired of the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that awaits us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion lap .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State appeared to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more precisely in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never been hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate , even humans with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting peace on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ o@@ wa and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs above the village LG@@ BT@@ Q depends not only on the night .
OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya occupied the international head@@ lines after reports published that them@@ ed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens of the gender equality of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life she moved to the United States last time .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per to a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; so there are no more men in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya who can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos from my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to get some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you dis@@ honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again at the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I first read his name at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have b@@ askets size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only hurt your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time , I realized that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that is a t@@ abo@@ o subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed here ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that no people were arrested and tort@@ ured during Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with that I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Ka@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
since then there has been nothing new about them .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t it have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 , I was already well known when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was true , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much more secure than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civi@@ liz@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed las@@ hes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to have children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased me and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this prob@@ ation period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who were laugh@@ ing and laugh@@ ed at one time , looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea re@@ efs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a p@@ enny for that .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ho@@ wling with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
do you know many think about Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty in men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all about it - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August reflected the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ ots who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a major part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab populations to dispute their livel@@ i@@ hood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi @-@ monarchy assumed power and had taken great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to evolve only slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs systematically work places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youth increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , finished primary school , finished 55 % and have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist , resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in recru@@ itment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last names in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awakening and knowing of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the Opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple beneath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin color , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q @-@ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been mis@@ used under rac@@ ism and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to sing , in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist orient@@ ated sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized entity in a historical sense .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex , because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better one .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differenti@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to fully and fully release myself from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the wh@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing - ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped which the black woman makes .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , for I exist in this paradig@@ m .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ addling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has always traveled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ epers Iraq Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker in Iraq based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and novel multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s moral in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the threshold of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena on charges of abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed display did not benefit .
a few days later , the second wife retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , when women get an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report to the law enforcement agencies .
content 1 blows and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system , that is nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t.@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reports and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 there were 9@@ 600 ads on account of domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace wars . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came here .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who ref@@ uses to act in Paraguay because of her mental abuse , there are nine women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not under@@ line anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should always repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ missive because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described her ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , they didn &apos;t get support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ comprehen@@ sible legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for@@ you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish the tough@@ er as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is to be lev@@ elled , which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to involve the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence currently have to carry , if they just want to display ads and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
those who are silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the off@@ ence of the perpet@@ rators .
we need to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back .

independent media in Oman suspended attacks a year after prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Cub@@ an authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ speaking az@@ am@@ n newspaper for their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later they were released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dismis@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , he is the prime minister in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterised by the harsh efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic secret services , the public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to restrict and det@@ ra@@ ct human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict access to peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , after appearing in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties adher@@ ing to the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured the Supreme Court judge in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Management , was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested by the Security Forces on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS fes@@ tively accepted Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , was banned on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mask@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were con@@ vic@@ ted , among other things , to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of inf@@ rin@@ gement of a prohibition of publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban on the profession was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 US dollars ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set up and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n , the paper still faces attacks by the om@@ ani government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to restore the publication of the paper .
the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ani authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protecting freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ der their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , photo takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research on @-@ site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists will help to build their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also star@@ ing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant disease patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipi@@ ents instead of being an own creator .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it be focused on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how Open Source seed producers change global food production
Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s article was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been growing let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the last few years more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants such as crop or carton types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned about food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs a longer time since his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to pump up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement growing ever greater in the United States and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red let@@ tu@@ ce of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name rather sounds as if the movement origin@@ ates from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , U.S. bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed @-@ bred seeds .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders alone allow others who buy seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not immediately plant it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the accredited professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater inter@@ relations such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the Open @-@ Source Movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; he says , and wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool shr@@ inks constantly due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant bre@@ eders either not at all or only makes it difficult to exploit .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat have been patented to a larger scale than salad or car@@ rots .
a Ques@@ tion of Vis@@ i@@ bility
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable features - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also essential for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company advoc@@ ates the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property includes other bre@@ eders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ets promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not in@@ hibit innovation , but encourages them by providing greater material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of using plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form it themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to use her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

in addition , Mort@@ on believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I am more powerful than companies that patent it with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which I think it &apos;s pretty easy to do . &quot; global response
although the USA seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre is collabor@@ ating with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it addresses the current practice of the European patent office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be planned next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and contribute to the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and organic foods has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still locked their contents on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5 August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
in August the network published a statement on Facebook where it strongly critic@@ ised Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information exists in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barrier and not to yield . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship of the Egyptian government is even the target of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also Zi@@ adas blog is given , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the blocking by the government and reflected what it means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of si@@ ege ; an arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , al@@ beit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked Web sites from 24 May to 6 August . this revealed technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the locking of providers which was possible by envel@@ op@@ ing internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer began .
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access .
the situation is also exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis with which they can proceed to trial against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in all Brazil are reporting with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the threshold of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non@@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published the Editorial Board on 16 August . &quot; this is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war break in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 8@@ 43 there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the paper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; War &quot; hurt more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is called &quot; war . &quot; in their opinion , this is a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to give account@@ ability to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglec@@ ting of the public service .
in memory : the state Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Jan@@ eiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ rates per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which emphas@@ ises how Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , the state &apos;s security policy has been repe@@ ating for years .
this policy also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP progres@@ sively became more under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why Viol@@ ence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; crazy glob@@ es . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is a week ago that the police kl@@ om@@ m the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities are suffering brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under si@@ ege , which led to the need for local people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large sections of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional food @-@ based foods and are very rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more &quot; of fame . &quot;
in order to earn money for the initiative , the Human@@ it@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity in 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , local prop@@ ell@@ ants from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger bowl . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard etc . ) to acquire new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017 bran@@ ching
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many regional cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15th and 16th . this led to the government spending last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite images , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
to give you a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &quot; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ ale of the Federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did not do this Sunday : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was ob@@ jected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; continues Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , were spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , following fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and at this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the Con@@ quest of Afghanistan began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractors .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected .
the T@@ ali@@ ban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars , which were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ i@@ hood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran has been shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we put nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high ratings . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
thus it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ ft@@ iness helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af thrust all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food outlet .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the topic of &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice restaurant in Pad@@ ua , and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : law dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ v@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the transfer of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot showing challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months after successful legislation decision on the authority website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or the submission of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of Parliament proposed a bill of law in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a senior official would be introduced .
under the Egyptian right , the President &apos;s ins@@ ul@@ ting as well as state institutions is already criminal . however , under the law of law , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he report@@ edly photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree to include arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
stop Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist for le@@ av@@ ened documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been inter@@ rog@@ ated mainly to a le@@ aked action plan . according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been supported by the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illegal funds received .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating articles 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code that sec@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he was a witness in the case at the District Court in Tunis on 09 May .
will China want to force users of social media to present their ID ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments can be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the State cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that &quot; organize the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as blocking in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site was blocked because it was &quot; an information source working with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is blocking its website completely . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to s@@ no@@ ff
following this week @-@ le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior .
