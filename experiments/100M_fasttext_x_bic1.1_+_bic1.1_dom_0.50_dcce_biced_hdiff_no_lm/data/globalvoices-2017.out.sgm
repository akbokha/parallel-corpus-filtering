<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who with the help of Julia Roberts covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections was the highest number ever achieved by the nominee nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpet Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump intolerance is also in stark contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for a long time, and to her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump steamed his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments on the cruel decision to elevate a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (picture of the white against all other ethnic groups, "white and whiplash based on white and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as the great Van Jones claimed, has killed exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast majority of the white American saying this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices became louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a Washington DC concert.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La banda de MÃºsica (musical bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed following a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, french horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reproduced instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recyclers began to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made out of apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from reproduced material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic MÃ¼lldeponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "those who live with him and of him are the poorest, like the people of Cateura, Paraguay." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilised against the ship. they refused to escort one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "" "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, launched in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who at that time had distributed the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate violation of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail pace, with which information was circulated between individual countries, the actions today happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is loading his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm who advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the network HISH-i loose each year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indicating imaginative species, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they deliberately utilize the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," says Long. "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You are not allowed to attack my port.'</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 tests of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships that are willing to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and by which the position of each tracking vessel can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what." "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the tracking of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detecting criminals, but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were fished without a license and hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">When FISH-i had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found tow-nets on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are a study object." "" "" "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" Security is the aim of bringing even more such initiatives and structures to other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship has also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing, "Bergh says.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative work method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="152">Her articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is escalating further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "recovering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Released under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the inauguration of the referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were running, reacted by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the reimbursement of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against it can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the areas of Barinas, in the Andenregions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north of the Federal Parliament Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate continuously, which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venetians by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new governance alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, urged the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on October 27th. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national Civil Defence and on 3 November all to Caracas to Miraflores Palace.</seg>
<seg id="167">More said! pic.twitter.com / 9ZyVGldNry</seg>
<seg id="168">@ MariaCorinaYA and @ soyfdelrincon: "tomorrow we go to the street with the National Assembly - @ NicolasMaduro must leave."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the reconquest of Venezuela"</seg>
<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme "The Recreconquest of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most shared images shows a protesters calling through the shields: "will you kill me, because I am hungry?"</seg>
<seg id="173">"will you kill me, because I am hungry?" cried out this Venezuelan.</seg>
<seg id="174">It is enough, without shit.</seg>
<seg id="175">To Miraflores today. # AMirafloresHoy # LaTomaDeVenezuela pic.twitter.com / k8LlZwrp4D</seg>
<seg id="176">Twitter piles images that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some protesters tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean state TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira have no skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic introduces the round, which forms the level of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs includes:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures are counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your inauguration!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from their point of view, has done little against the disastrous economic crisis and prefers to keep critical voices silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The Marches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapting version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, it is not noticeable that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of intelligence division 141 in La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified of a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="220">You're an asshole, you've enjoyed yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Passport just that they don't run you one day and then I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a tiny bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put down and held me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was confined there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom bound a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it out with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eyes.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came up from above that they were to be laid.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time at the age, I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war booty is a bayonet or perhaps military detachment, which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought.</seg>

<seg id="330">After four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historic La Perla Ribera trial ended with crimes against 716 victims in August, between March 1975 and December 1978.</seg>
<seg id="331">43 of the oppressors were found guilty of crimes against humanity, and in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years. in six cases, there were acquittals.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, last month witness a particularly missuccessful translation.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Revision of the original photographs by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could this translate into such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, even grammatically not entirely correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the bug was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger informed about the apologies:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are really sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News discontinued with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved nationwide in accidents are quite a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, equivalent to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens triggered 1.803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">In this way, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has dropped overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors rose during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The unnamed reporter brought comments to the light published in Yahoo's version of the article, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to have against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation error received among others the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "-" "" "" "" "Is this not the reality" "" "" "" "terrible car driver" "" "" "" "?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The website Engrish.com is a real treasure trove for these bizarre mistakes in English.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may be due to lacking understanding of translating, cost-jumping or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, nevertheless make translations available internally. then the Japanese staff, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic propositions that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translation can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city hopefully uses a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet pages of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also transferred photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was cut, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among veneers with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission considered this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I signed up at @ vivoplaynet with no cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates their sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests for specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds erroneously or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ vPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third-locked channel, the broadcast was closed on Thursday, 6 April when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who recorded the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay, many girls become slaves to receive education</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness testimonies from other Criaditas, who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Voices, courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "the one from which something has become" "" "" "", "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned here, however, is that the children have to afford countless days of housework which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with the Criadita is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family, who, in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation with faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will only learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent strokes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was a member of the former military hospital TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira hit MarÃ­n as long as she suffered fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the deeply rooted practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that "no further Carolina" can be found in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be a trend-setting case - when for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to enroll bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and started to sell sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that her time was still learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, cleaning the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was finished with learning, the more leisure she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make supper for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the landlord Alvarenga was forced to stand beside him and read editorial articles such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He considered it intelligently, but did not stay with it. "the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would" learn bad habits "there again." so they said that Alvarenga, belonging to the indigenous group of Guarani, would return home again to their mother tongue GuaranÃ­.</seg>
<seg id="473">Her masters feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which is almost never spoken is mobbing and the harassment that Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time, where friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty-six Egyptian MPs have recently agreed on a bill to "Regulatory Regulations regarding the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When accepted by Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to share social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring with it a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a cash buckle.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"" "" "" "Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password" "" "" "" "to get through the firewall blocked by Facebook." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "conducting research technologist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring it into a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="524">This post by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, that roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big carnivore is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. therefore, when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">It has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, and the region is still busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the north-east of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple-catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a state-of-the-art prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">To this end, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, and only because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been made six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction agency as well as survey results of the concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ("" "" "" "" hangar "" "" "" "") were finished in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to list the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from housing meetings ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "caetsu juutaku) settle into final replacement houses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of those evacuated after disaster were settled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1,074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have reopened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely been affected by the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima is also lagging behind here as well.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers find it more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed from the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to this article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still hasn't been done enough in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disastrous nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 people evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23,000 people had been resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated people are still in temporary shelters, older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking a different language, the differences appear to be larger than the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, Global Voices Podcast, we're looking at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we discuss topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Goiana with a headstock. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures too, the police officer's face was seen, which attacked a whip. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s admitted that Sampaio had been suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in Goiana with his whip on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit his face would be visible six months on TV and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz in the net, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are shortly after him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus living in another federal state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers across the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window-window.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo deliberately reported on a broken glass window in order to make their title pages illustrative with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo favored a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window record than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso hundreds of sugar cane factories joined the doors in Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar-harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran who runs every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation again because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds you that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resists plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose some decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly come into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, got their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeated most, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closure year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed, the addssat and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everyone was signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use Hip-Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it with hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus shows that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the district of the Kiteschkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Ttears," a road section in West Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most cases have not been solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemesaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people didn't always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator dictates to.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to Silenschrift (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, close to the entrance Shokuhin sanpuru ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "plastic models of the dishes" "" "" "" ") are exhibited by any dish served in this restaurant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small businesses producing just those plastic dishes that German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic rubbing decorated mobile tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into cheesy collection objects, such as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly complicated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy-stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, chura and salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there someone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand-made straps made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Additional skurish plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # orios (s) real estate promotion of the # 30 Special Occupation posts.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi District, devoted to supplying the restaurant industry. such as the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal polÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how frightened life changes") relates precisely these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephew on a single day.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories written by readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from the files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent in doing so or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the inaction of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour resort are justified by being" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they don't move and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was plundered with threats," she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business by month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I wondered whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chchi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Mordes. this corresponds to the average rate of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are still living in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or declaring falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a horrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its inception, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample meticulous coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to that.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses wrapped up including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses contaminated and chartered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das is Nigeria." the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies, which are lined up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was examined several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses testified dramatically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one left to count bodies," "" "" "" "said a man to Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange was also associated with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following relate to those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claiming that Myanmar's President Thein Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source also mistakenly attribute Thein to this statement, but had not related the image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false decoupling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an "reverse picture search," you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found among 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures that are very similar to the image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed lot of private pages, platforms of social media and collaborative as well as national publications and are available in many different languages, including English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded false reports, some have tried to expose falsifications.</seg>

<seg id="900">Even within Nigeria, the photo from DR Congo was seen as evidence of the bombing of Boko Haram in Kano in public discussion forums.</seg>
<seg id="901">Malaysia, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="902">Malaysia provides two extreme example of an abusive use of the image from DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet expressing sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger, the claims that Rohingya are being prosecuted, since the photos were used abusive.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar government posted a right to judge what it referred to as "intentionally finged news and photos, the international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstandings with regard to Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="907">This post, addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community, realises that the image of DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar admitted that in 2012, that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and the image is still included in this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now released news page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it constitutes a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was subsequently circulated in the context of the Boko Haram massacre by 2015, the newspaper El Pais attempted to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yorDÃ¼nyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of DR Congo emerged with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture has been weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages connected with it have not been taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnamese and declared it falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image was from DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretiner Missionaries and Padre Juan Carlos Martos distanced himself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of erroneous use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">In other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (in grey) TinEye will also point out, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web crawler and occasionally have image file names linked to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the image will ultimately be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts, the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally take part in dropping the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this sentiment of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and it makes the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regards to violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news. they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can be used by the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of false write-ups should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo created by Andy Simmons in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. irreplaceable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese sauda) and others rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are necessary in order to precisely understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the vanity language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get tired of your parents in recognition of how to care for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after getting warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilaya and Attanagalu obya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to a statement by the Emergency Centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing for the floods and mud-avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100 000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos show an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Tap water in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five will be completed to transport emergency deliveries for the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forced Saudi, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1114">The Podcast See Something, Say Something by Buzzfeed; the podcast # GoodMuslimBadMuslim; the viral video series Secret Lives of Muslims; Sapelo Square about black, American Muslims; Simon & amp; Schuster Salam Reads, an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Marvel, the PAKISTANDING, Muslim, American superheroine - all this makes me hope.</seg>

<seg id="1117">But I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are.</seg>
<seg id="1118">And this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1119">There is one reason that conspiracy theorists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They have grown exponentially because they have Muslims to "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group which has grown exponentially by creating the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years earlier, they had not yet given them; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was unaware of when I was as old as it was now my daughter, but who made me today an unbound Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left here like a sandwich in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that perhaps awaken memories, for in all the intersections that our humanity puts forth, a story may lurk where someone is made to another.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley Conversations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where but Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are fought and people were enthroned by the creation of the "other" in the public image four decades ago was the scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of the "others" to solidify, just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we have no president, while he already bombs broken countries and "other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening to these events is often associated with understanding," these events should instead be "listening in order to appreciate, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain their story in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience can be listened to.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language of Dafing. during this tour the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamamusara tells the tale of Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the goal of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, which are up to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was declared by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Citizens' Front for the Noise Testing of Debt) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reestablishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their call:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' in three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real cost with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to make some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra-Prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Memory" gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police bass was based on a command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the conductor of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the cultural prototypical prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct Palmyra's ancient ruins.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here blend greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began his work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of SysEx but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel hasn't been able to finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty free.</seg>

<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: post-release director sentenced to previous post on account of corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, together with four other defendants, on account of embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800,000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at Mozambique's airports, whose advice was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who rejected the request, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not conduct any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our judicial system, such as the CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contradicts.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "reluctant":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory to me!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambian and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him and I can't believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state," "" "" "" "he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible money source, and the state itself had become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded so much.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is imprisoned:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mozambians, but also as a keen, incisive and - by the way - a prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he affirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he does not change tactics, but he does not turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "" "" "an ambitious human being is simultaneously criminal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment; he was sitting for 10 years and was released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he is making money, puts it under contract again. # AssimvaiOMeuPais - Import items (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12 May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censors many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmesan word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or crackpeas.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although there is still a discussion about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective, "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censors the word "Kalar" or "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesan words with basic meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(gap),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook doesn't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is time to cut off their nationalism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the campaign may send a strong signal to all those who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts by telling his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I became aware of this new Facebook guideline, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "did not correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but that's not how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they discovered that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook-automated censorship has caused a lot of scott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate language, but were still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously adopted a law prohibiting this practice, so that the marriage-ready age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere with the fact that age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "" "" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner for the UN Child Rights Convention that defines minors as" "" "" "" "every person under the age of 18." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavoured to abolish laws on the toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "a Hindu leader Z. B. had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's marriage, they should," "" "" "" "take care of their own affairs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition meant tension in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would have made him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it has been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childbirth had finally been amended.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial post at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that obscured the core of the matter, but do you know what? the marriage of children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1366">The marriage-ready age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposal for amending the marriage network was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most well-known Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to have made his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users desired that the debate would approach the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so universally, in a way that can only invite panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters from it, protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in favor of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they underline.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking its popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many Internet users are used to using tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now appearing.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set out everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least check out all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and is merely screenshots and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site by Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as collaborators at Mozilla's Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attaches to another URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just returned home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as fearful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood face-face to Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Buhek appeared. he sits right away, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for del" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for fostering Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should despise the norm, get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to mention the name is also widespread among men. however, they have to fear far less assignments if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices such as Children's Heyal up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and directs this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying loudly the names of their husbands is a custom that they have duelessly upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not observe this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband lingered for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "then she asked everyone," "" "" "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands about their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled in front of him during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustration of him and his family by cursing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that at home they would actually try to call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the vermilion dot on the forehead that indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why just need women to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband, that I would carry the vermilion dot if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry who could hear what could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for many years now and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most that's okay, but some wanted a Salwar-Kurta, a wide shirt about a pants, wearing; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed a little, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the filing for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of bald people for organ trading, presumably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border with Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and a part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they had confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, declared the police officer of ZambÃ©zia the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to a mission accomplished by the UN 2016 in the South African country to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique after Mosambique are target ritual attacks, the Mozambique police warned according to the latest murders of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM thinks that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in strife (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims were in the head power to create the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state endangerment), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China referred to Lius case as "an internal matter," and a spokesman says that he considers it "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still gaining views from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government told that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations only continued in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to collect his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for release of Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we also expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr Lius's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1653">Speaking in the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, the AFP news agency announced on 27 June that the embassy asked Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The call for the US Embassy has drawn a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and unanswerable comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with the fact that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical care of the choice they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1660">German spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on 3 July, Berlin hope that Liu "gets all the medical support he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the buzz around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide a proper medical care to Liu and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum keeps on telling:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those perished for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, France's foreign ministry called for China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Book Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very concerned in a statement on June 28 and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius Well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish, since Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice" "" "" "" "twist the logic" "" "" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of which he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as we reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre comes up again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, since they are better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam replies to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really no answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He pointed out corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out the critiques that you should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he stated why the elections in Singapore are so unbalanced even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>

<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said Singapore" "" "" "" "no country" "" "" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of Singapore's political leaders, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes he is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr Shanmugam perpetuated a mistake "or was it a Freudian advocate?</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumours about certain parts of the world uncovered and another facet to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question asked most in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer then. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is deemed polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification generally follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook internally in anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All the Canadians love.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began traveling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small maple sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapon with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>

<seg id="1757">"" "" "" "we obviously say very often" "" "" "" "sorry." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First of all, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me, for example, if you would confuse me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: being called "nice," basically means being spit - like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian double-tail).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">It can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice," is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often talk to the neighbors over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister made Canada downright sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodiert Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A Pop band in Thailand released a music video released by the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations his girlfriend is doing.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days, the video posted on Facebook was divided 1,254 times and received 8,800 listings.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as regards the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution given to the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "change in employment" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed as critics by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above illustrates the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, which monitors and supervises online content and prosecuted people who accused the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict mindset against "Lese Majeste" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only slowly recovers in East-East Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed more than 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasic war was officially ended, but its scars are still very visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern districts in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchava are located in the coal basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia Minor, Georgians and Armenians have lived and worked together towards Soviet leaders in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, mostly Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people after barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s, called Khruschkovsky, are symbolic of the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1827">It is still unambiguous. "</seg>
<seg id="1828">Before the war, the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centres, schools and kindergartens that served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded splendor buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">About fifty people live in the ghost town of Dzhantukha.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushchatkas that house one or two families, one recognizes at the balconies, where laundry is dried.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>

<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (cultivation of agricultural products for self-consumption) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable growing.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to come across the rounds.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balsam the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he answers with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel it suits you as African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the track and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a building worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wonder if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her that her guests often send her messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and its family have included immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," he says. "" "" "" "" I have experienced what they are experiencing. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people help and others cannot help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula are coming from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to extort money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers will quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she feeds on her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she introduces her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeat it every time. "they have been gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a cell phone alert, in which it prompts the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the communication it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, news with a private WeChat group had been replaced.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">JingWang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is to block pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often impose extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter based media outlet "images from mainland China" ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "message" "" "" "" "in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checking out whether they had installed the surveillance app." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by a rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ") published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council of the Party to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, government agencies and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" from local police until 1 August.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" video. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2038">After a few minutes, feeling like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried communication method: strike with the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cellular comrade was an "first respite."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation, he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently none of the surrounding cells lay in a respected middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness no distinctive features can be recognized, and doctors don't exist here; we are all numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would leave him if I remain.</seg>

<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have had a scarecrow in order to expel all these crows, which are labelled by the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From afar, I still hear them screaming "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries sound every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the color of perdition, until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person: the Raad (for example: "thunder," allusion to the 13th sure of the Koran).</seg>

<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was lifted: in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of view of their view of the world.</seg>

<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>

<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you can't keep your screams back.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams did not suffice to him yet, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and did not find any favour, which is why he attacked an electrically charged rod as the next one.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes even to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeyees (e.g.: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioning her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all of these themes are relevant not only in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by limitations, and according to his own statement he can feel with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he hates a special upgrade against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as the "Palestinian refuge of the second generation" - so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured into water dissolved NescafÃ© into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lugs of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry has cancelled the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "precisely" because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that constitutes the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "stand up" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect a more and more clearly crystallising reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib drew back traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trebled unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'honourable murders' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still difficult to support Jordan's institutional infrastructure in order to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the crime of crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "indefinite times be kept in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the warranty on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music is also very popular and is well-known for not to shy away from issues that have long taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he can't separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been taught me," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note that his comments were torn, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a worked version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advocates the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the 8th century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the teachers' association, arguing that they have critically criticised the problems inherent in the country's deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs show is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially induced democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will continue and resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to Fellow as a student.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warp dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas Tohocus in August. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years ago, in which armies from the west of Japan marched to the Northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, hosted a two month exhibition on Wa no Akari (wÃ¶rth).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two forts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-high solid car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external apparitions and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing rising demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdresser art instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year commenced in March and reported some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "declaration of love to guerrilla fighters," published by the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel pushed out to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was precisely the question of the two young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n campaign (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombianists, however, there is a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">GuerrillacÃ¤mpfer, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed war rhetoric and had their arms round the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share in this year his love with people who urgently needed acclaim.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said the political student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience like this:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a lethal weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "" "" "he replied," "" "" "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "someone has never written something so beautiful in my life, so I answer." "" "" "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the grenade-thrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he too was tired of the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion lap.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State appeared to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more precisely in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never been hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate, even humans with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would rule after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC are now putting peace on a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya occupied the international headlines after reports published that themed the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chechens of the gender equality of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life she moved to the United States last time.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper to a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone of whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "so there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos from my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to get some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you dishonor the family?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only hurt your family but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you have to disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't believe you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "just to prove it: it is number 115." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed here?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine tells me there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kayrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new about them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't it have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003, I was already well known when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was true, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to" "" "" "" "civilizations" "" "" "", "but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to have children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased me and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this probation period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who were laughing and laughed at one time, looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea reefs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a penny for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no howling with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about Transidentity in men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all about it - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August reflected the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who work in Ahwaz want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi Minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriots who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a major part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab populations to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy assumed power and had taken great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to evolve only slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahwazi Arabs systematically work places in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams to divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youth increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, finished primary school, finished 55% and have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, residing in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in recruitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not pretend to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last names in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awakening and knowing of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the Opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple beneath." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin color, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been misused under racism and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to sing, in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist orientated sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demended and marginalized entity in a historical sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex, because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better one.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to fully and fully release myself from feminism and to join the movement of the whomanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming - (for example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which the black woman makes.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, for I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa has always traveled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Waterkeepers Iraq Non-Governmental Organisation - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker in Iraq based in Erbil, Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena on charges of abuse, Ada BÃ¡ez's well-informed display did not benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife retired.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, when women get an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 blows and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system, that is nothing undernimmt.3 Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various reports and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 there were 9600 ads on account of domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace wars. here, too, 86% of women's advertisements came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who refuses to act in Paraguay because of her mental abuse, there are nine women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "" "" "she declared at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not underline anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should always repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described her insults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives, they didn't get support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an incomprehensible legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but cannot be applied." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">A bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament on 10 August 2016 under the hashtag # Porellas (# foryou).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foresees to declare Feminid to an independent criminal record and to punish the tougher as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is to be levelled, which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to involve the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence currently have to carry, if they just want to display ads and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the offence of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the submission of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is regarded as a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arabic-speaking azamn newspaper for their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put to trial, but later they were released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he is the prime minister in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the harsh efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secret services, the public liberties, including freedom of the press, to restrict and detract human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict access to peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closing and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces captured Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, after appearing in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties adhering to the judiciary." this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having pressured the Supreme Court judge in Oman to suspend a ruling in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher al-Abri, a member of the Board of Management, was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested by the Security Forces on his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS festively accepted Deputy Editor-in-Chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as Chief Editor after Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way, including online, was banned on August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial of the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the court in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were convicted, among other things, to disturbance of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of infringement of a prohibition of publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 US dollars each (7800 US dollars), and a one-year ban on the profession was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 US dollars (13 000 US dollars) was set up and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj continues to be in prison, where he served his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to release Azamn, the paper still faces attacks by the omani government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to restore the publication of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing shutdown of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing shutdown of Azamn and the incarceration of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omani authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Iranian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the Azamn newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protecting freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman unhinder their legitimate human rights work without fear of retaliation, including legal harassment.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, photo takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research on-site: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists will help to build their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samb health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samb national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it be focused on, and how can we support the development?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how Open Source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">Rachel Cernansky's article was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been growing lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants such as crop or carton types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned about food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but he now needs a longer time since his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is like a boulder in a river that I have to pump up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement growing ever greater in the United States and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red lettuce of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement originates from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the movement for free open source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called OSSI, U.S. breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed-bred seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders alone allow others who buy seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not immediately plant it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the accredited professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater interrelations such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the Open-Source Movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed," he says, and wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool shrinks constantly due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders either not at all or only makes it difficult to exploit.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat have been patented to a larger scale than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable features - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto Speaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also essential for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company advocates the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property includes other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varietets promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing greater material and expertise to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years of waiting until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton interferes with the concept of using plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to use herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto) patents, most smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am more powerful than companies that patent it with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which I think it's pretty easy to do. "global response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, introduces a "open source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre is collaborating with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the OSSI obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it addresses the current practice of the European patent office, which permits patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official start-up should be planned next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange it and contribute to the seed policy, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby of OSSI hopes that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still locked their contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5 August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August the network published a statement on Facebook where it strongly criticised Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information exists in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barrier and not to yield. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government is even the target of an attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom also Ziadas blog is given, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced to the blocking by the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, a attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked Web sites from 24 May to 6 August. this revealed technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the locking of providers which was possible by enveloping internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis with which they can proceed to trial against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army at the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos pÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all Brazil are reporting with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air wafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the threshold of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian nongovernmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" published the Editorial Board on 16 August. "this is not normal" in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens to the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war break in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "War" hurt more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is called "war." in their opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to give accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglecting of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "if we look at the morrates per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which emphasises how CecÃ­lia emphasises, the state's security policy has been repeating for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">This policy also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP progressively became more under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, explaining why Violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "crazy globes."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is a week ago that the police klomm the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities are suffering brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organization and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to the need for local people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food products such as meat have become unattainable for large sections of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghouta, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to conventional food-based foods and are very rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that for three years he has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more "of fame."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to earn money for the initiative, the Humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge about the planting of fungi, Dr. Leila zu Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, local propellants from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of mushrooms from the regions" before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21st in many regional cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15th and 16th. this led to the government spending last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors forest areas by satellite images, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity from case to case, if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," continues JoÃ£o Sorval in the same article of PÃºblico newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, were spreading, as in a vicious circle, following fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when citizens were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it used the own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and at this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in the autumn of 1994, the Conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractors.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, which were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran has been shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," reminded Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we put nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" special "" "" "" "special" "" "" "" "special reception centres." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained liftiness helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf thrust all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food outlet.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the topic of "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp; Spice restaurant in Padua, and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2923">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "thus, they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: law drafts from Egypt enable shutdown social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adavya in Cairo, which protested against the transfer of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months after successful legislation decision on the authority website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or the submission of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of Parliament proposed a bill of law in which tougher penalties for the insult of the president or a senior official would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the Egyptian right, the President's insulting as well as state institutions is already criminal. however, under the law of law, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he reportedly photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearing was postponed to 20 May, because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty on account of one, so many human rights groups agree to include arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting on pro-Morsi session block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Stop Tunisian activist for leavened documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been interrogated mainly to a leaked action plan. according to the plan, Ben Gharbia has been supported by the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all illegal funds received.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April, sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia leaned the nomination of his sources, stating articles 11 of the Tunisian press code that secures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he was a witness in the case at the District Court in Tunis on 09 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China want to force users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments can be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these regulations to protect citizen journalism and independence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the State censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an "organiser of the distribution of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that "organize the publication of the information." the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias blocking in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site was blocked because it was "an information source working with groups to address a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey is blocking its website completely. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to snoff</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week-leaked documents, Britain's government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
