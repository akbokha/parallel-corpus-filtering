this is James Ris@@ en .
they probably know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against cra@@ cks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous they give away .
so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they told years that it was essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing to make cra@@ cks , they could also carry out their digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly taken care of his telephone numbers ,
as well as his email data , financial and bank information , his credit information , and even travel warnings with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey &apos;s ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and crack .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer in his resig@@ nation . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just like the government &apos;s technology to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet when cra@@ cks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer provide information and much of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that are all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to reveal mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and want to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest date of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money are hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next un@@ veiled documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a spy killer , or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be removed from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and the powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
media and leading politicians all around the world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth - something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came forward in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , some US states require less information than to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it allows sc@@ ams to rip off particularly vulnerable off@@ springs .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single tip politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour harder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very melanch@@ oly , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has registered in central regi@@ sters at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sales outlet .
a guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a wild alien sleep in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , ti@@ dy on ti@@ to@@ es at the door and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my angle of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as a foreig@@ ner in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something to it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes have been completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door came into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ wh@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to fire .
but they do not act .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people &apos;s homes .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you get on the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your locked cell phone to your left @-@ seated person .
this soft touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ? if he had told us where to come from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really grab very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give up negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest handed out their assessments before we put them on @-@ line .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three judgments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation attracts common@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
one tells too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother . &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; Great art@@ works in your home ! I do a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dism@@ iss these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that had not been met before .
the business runs very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parti@@ ys or homes ra@@ v@@ aged .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem .
for people trust each other in a right way .
when confidence is working , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives even though they don &apos;t know a right one .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital , if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by .
you can stay one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now it &apos;s just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of residents would wait for a thorough ref@@ ill and show you a quarter of a pub that you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place of residence ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children had been moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
the hospitality already existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did it work exactly ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after , ques@@ tioned , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devot@@ ion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock rapidly turned into rebellion .
why should you do such a thing ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern origin ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- when we drove silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I felt the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t panic . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslims .
there were really attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have dra@@ gged the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can actually hear people today : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my community like a tumor in the US body .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olymp@@ ians .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America more secure ?
there may be some parking lots , but not stopping terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show greater civi@@ c involvement .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alisation process , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still asser@@ t that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups asser@@ t their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , it does not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which lets them read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her rage , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m made the connection with God and its church again .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows that if people present messages that have been adver@@ sely reported on Muslims , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
in the allocation of collective blame , it is not only about self @-@ explaining .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you hold a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive myself . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest study conducted on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule has often been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air packaging penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces .
they can also build self @-@ regul@@ ating structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collec@@ tively aware where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands can be run on the highest level e. g . &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has big advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a restriction of stern @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear ru@@ dder .
we recently discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest @-@ to @-@ use aircraft . it was invented in front of sh@@ orts .
it has only one movable part , one propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly soli@@ dly , and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of just throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in ti@@ mid@@ ation , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will demonstrate that by fli@@ ght@@ fully fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to develop new revolutionary ideas .
the specially safe press there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth part into pure energy .
this short moment they lighten@@ ed more bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set it free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing by us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly Mu@@ tiger -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometric gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition rate enor@@ mously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ec@@ tors were commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes flew through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that I &apos;ve been working for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and her signals measur@@ able by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the room and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and smo@@ ked in the other .
instruc@@ tors in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a real @-@ liberal dance to illustrate the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and du@@ de , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched out and stopped at the opening of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os according to the com@@ ma followed by a 1 . that is why one declared the Lig@@ o employees for nuts .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob stops her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
listening to gravity can tell us about the col@@ lision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ pregn@@ ated in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No@@ someone who knows what he must hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold amount of sun , which rotate as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes take place in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own reflection .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things which we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we hadn &apos;t expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes like lig@@ o they are observing are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start acting ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do just that , whereas I was afraid I removed my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply on an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; ta@@ xing , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , catch you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cycle television . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days $ 20 million television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production , four epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that yet ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a class@@ room , take a business or a home , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just ro@@ aming around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t want to dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is like I put troops on , as if I painted on a canvas .
so as to wear a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , st@@ ress@@ ful and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the sum that I &apos;m writing over writing that writing gives me pleasure .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I began to work and work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you won &apos;t be able to asp@@ ire to size .
the feeling of being unable to be different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I will , the more epis@@ odes , the more epis@@ odes , the more work there are , the more work there , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectation there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work @-@ title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bud@@ ding , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same tit@@ an @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not sleep , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a demonstration Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when you suddenly f@@ ade out the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ w yourself , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no more than two things are being made aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m titanium and my bu@@ zz is drunk , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the titanium thumb , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the pleasure of life .
real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pers to me the false words , because which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ a@@ holic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t know how to play , how work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of man does he prefer to be a home ?
well , I do .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
the fact that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we are spe@@ eding around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we rent soap bub@@ bles .
I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children tell me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie will replace me .
and talking to me my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , it doesn &apos;t need more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are included !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of labour is part of me , but just one part . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s sn@@ aking to me that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life is spreading in me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll stir you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions .
they surely have one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain to influence the switching circuits of neur@@ ons in a way that improves the neurolog@@ ical function .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma swell@@ s the brain and increases cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , you have to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly divided themselves and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have it in our brain .
they consist of 4 % of our cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ones .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they ensure the bra@@ ins of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then marking them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we pl@@ agu@@ ed them at the point of departure of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are mat@@ uring these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pl@@ unge the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we stimul@@ ated the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and stimul@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been stimul@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor sensor area in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic bra@@ brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side , they see the monkeys that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after plant@@ ation .
I can tell you these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant it in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the major obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable ti@@ ghtness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a genuine democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , China &apos;s Communist Party , and even the Euro@@ group are failing to believe us , could save us democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ ensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are mur@@ der@@ ous , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations which , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and bring income by which one could take off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time stood around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ame the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors , which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they would not invest .
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
the in@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which allowed them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same weigh@@ ting in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is burnt out quickly .
however , our present @-@ day liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present democra@@ cies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and the economy began , and the economy gradually under@@ went politics and made it clear .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because these days it can be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is emig@@ rated to the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is roughly like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , the economy , which has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized politics , is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political est@@ ates are de@@ valued , ine@@ quality rises , the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t look very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste greater , and the social conflicts go deeper , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of business and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re @-@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a disease hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that the society resembles in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life indul@@ ges .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and from proceeds , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction is made between those who belong to the company but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no scor@@ ching twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is spent by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; Kosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is also liber@@ ally in which it fav@@ ours privileged persons , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the gar@@ bage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... doing this not , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is certainly relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek one , a kind of philosophi@@ cal statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area , where most of it plays , is a completely democratic zone .
in a way , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to submit to China now , to do what the West has done in the ninet@@ eenth century , sm@@ ells tremendous after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive rejection line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to progress , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the credi@@ tors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government to a halt , just because they did not want to deal with the rejection going through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the exposed planes will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what it seems to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price have never heard most , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right hand side of that curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ tive to where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to pro@@ hibit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle dig@@ ression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create achievements .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon releases things free of charge , it &apos;s up to you , right ?
millions of spectators watch these epis@@ odes .
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that assi@@ mil@@ ates everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and it reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com above four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewers : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com above four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic indicates that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you &apos;re in prison .
if someone is in jail in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an om@@ ission takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always producing the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was able to predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way of forec@@ asting -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fla@@ w@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data streams into decisions of life - at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the individual items together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision , especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tells us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ ap or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what one does and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
