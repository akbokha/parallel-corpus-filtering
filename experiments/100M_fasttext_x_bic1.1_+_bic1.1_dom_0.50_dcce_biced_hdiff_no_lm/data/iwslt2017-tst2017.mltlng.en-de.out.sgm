<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They probably know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern, whistleblower to condemn and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give away.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, although they told years that it was essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to make cracks, they could also carry out their digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly taken care of his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as his email data, financial and bank information, his credit information, and even travel warnings with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey's sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower in his resignation. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that didn't exist yet when cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer provide information and much of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that are all jeopardizing us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a way to reveal misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and want to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who strikes alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest date of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money are hidden in tax havens] [What does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mail boxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a spy killer, or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be removed from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and the powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Media and leading politicians all around the world discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their wealth - something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states require less information than to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It allows scams to rip off particularly vulnerable offsprings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single tip politician, involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour harder." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very melancholy, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has registered in central registers at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate to end this type of intransparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop the intransparency which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sales outlet.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Look, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, tidy on titoes at the door and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my angle of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as a foreigner in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something to it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes have been completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door came into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blewhczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's homes.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you get on the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your locked cell phone to your left-seated person.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name? if he had told us where to come from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really grab very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give up negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest handed out their assessments before we put them on-line.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation attracts commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother." -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "Great artworks in your home! I do a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismiss these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business runs very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed partiys or homes ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other in a right way.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives even though they don't know a right one.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital, if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but now it's just a" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the thing is not fair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group of residents would wait for a thorough refill and show you a quarter of a pub that you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place of residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children had been moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">The hospitality already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People probably don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, questioned, doubted and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>

<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Middle Eastern origin..." "..." Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>

<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- when we drove silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I felt the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Abide in well-lit areas," "Don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my community like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking lots, but not stopping terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic involvement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalisation process, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family, so that the extremists are a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam made the connection with God and its church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people present messages that have been adversely reported on Muslims, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective blame, it is not only about self-explaining.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has my brother become such an accomplished young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you hold a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble think tank, an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive myself. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest study conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then the rule has often been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is just about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packaging penetrated into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the public. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-regulating structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively aware where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be run on the highest level e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has big advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest-to-use aircraft. it was invented in front of shorts.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly solidly, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of just throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in timidation, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by flightfully flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to develop new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The specially safe press there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth part into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened more brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set it free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing by us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly Mutiger -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves that arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition rate enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detectors were commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two collidiating black holes flew through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I've been working for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and her signals measurable by observatories like Ligo. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the room and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and smoked in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Instructors in courses on the theory of relativity often perform a real-liberal dance to illustrate the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dude, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched out and stopped at the opening of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros according to the comma followed by a 1. that is why one declared the Ligo employees for nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "" "" "said Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves:" "" "" "" "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob stops her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, impregnated in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] Nosomeone who knows what he must hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold amount of sun, which rotate as fast as the rods of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes take place in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is hidden by its own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things which we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run that we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes like ligo they are observing are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the saurierknochen for our archaeological work, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for one year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "before I was afraid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start acting?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do just that, whereas I was afraid I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply on an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "" "" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "" "" "estimations" "" "" "" "for unexplained reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"taxing, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I cycle television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days $20 million television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production, four episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "" "" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "" "" "author" "" "" "" "falls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a home, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just roaming around the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I don't want to dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go deeper into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I put troops on, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as to wear a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, stressful and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I explain to them the sum that I'm writing over writing that writing gives me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I began to work and work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you won't be able to aspire to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being unable to be different than striving for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I know only that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectation there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single work-title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson said:" "" "" "" "budding, I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titan-work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not sleep, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a demonstration Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when you suddenly fade out the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "haw yourself, stupid author-titanium." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're doing it, you're working, you're a teacher, a banker, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the buzzing when the buzz is stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern state waitress" "" "" "" "asks me a question." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I'm on the way out, late and she says:" "" "" "" "mum, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no more than two things are being made aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "" "" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "" "" "estimating." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm titanium and my buzz is drunk, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of buzz, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium thumb, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the pleasure of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispers to me the false words, because which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the summing again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't know how to play, how work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of man does he prefer to be a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I do.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">The fact that I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are speeding around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We rent soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to me my teenie-daughter for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, it doesn't need more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are included!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what's good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my free time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of labour is part of me, but just one part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snaking to me that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the real buzz: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life is spreading in me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "" "" "I said" "" "" "" "Yes" "" "" "" "to less work and more games." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They surely have one of the most well-known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted in the brain to influence the switching circuits of neurons in a way that improves the neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain trauma swells the brain and increases cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly divided themselves and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have it in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They consist of 4% of our cerebral cortones.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they ensure the brains of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then marking them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we plagued them at the point of departure of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are maturing these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plunge the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we stimulated the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and stimulated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor sensor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brabrain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand side, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the major obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable tightness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, China's Communist Party, and even the Eurogroup are failing to believe us, could save us democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are murderous, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations which, however, are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and bring income by which one could take off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time stood around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflame the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of the investors, which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, in which they would not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">The inproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "" "" "but before we continue:" "" "" "" "what do we mean by democracy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which allowed them the right to political co-determination with the same weighting in questions of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and the economy began, and the economy gradually underwent politics and made it clear.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because these days it can be in the government, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the divisions are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is roughly like a herd of predators that have so sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, the economy, which has so far cannibalized politics, is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political estates are devalued, inequality rises, the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste greater, and the social conflicts go deeper, as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the spheres of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-unified field, otherwise we end up in a disease hyperautocracy that lets the film "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie similar to that in "matrix," or something that the society resembles in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life indulges.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and from proceeds, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction is made between those who belong to the company but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no scorching twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is spent by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "Kosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is also liberally in which it favours privileged persons, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... doing this not, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers described as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is certainly relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek one, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area, where most of it plays, is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a way, if I can say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To submit to China now, to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells tremendous after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece's finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that is to say goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive rejection line passed through the eurozone and continues to progress, which massively threatens the development of the entire European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was the first proposal that revealed this denial --" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose the denial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price have never heard most, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right hand side of that curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website, IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addictive to where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle digression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases things free of charge, it's up to you, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they're being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that assimilates everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and it reads:" "" "" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom above four Republican U.S. Senators." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they took a venture and decided not to make a sitcom above four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "" "" "yes," "" "" "" "House of Cards" "" "" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic indicates that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you're in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an omission takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was able to predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way of forecasting -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data streams into decisions of life - at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people inconceivably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the individual items together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision, especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds wherever they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "this tells us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a jap or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much smarter than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what one does and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
