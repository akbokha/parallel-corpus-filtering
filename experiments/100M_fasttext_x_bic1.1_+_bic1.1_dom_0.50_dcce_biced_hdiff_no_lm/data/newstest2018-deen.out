Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today .
a pit chapel , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is now being excav@@ ated .
gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the ru@@ sty ground of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official card promotes exciting stories about days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , who had to get upset already , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the state government , are anything but current - but especially therefore very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ board carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called original papers , were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and villages .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische glori@@ fication administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and arose from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon sum@@ med up an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9th , 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours , who created the idea of a region @-@ wide Bavaria map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph progres@@ sed the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian State Meas@@ u@@ rement Management .
the original document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of earlier / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which appears to be relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , in the year 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebas@@ tien Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original photo &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
today small plots do not show farmers any more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the field of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height of &quot; On the Venti@@ lation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once blocked people with del@@ usions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte . &quot;
starting in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example ended the ban@@ qu@@ eting of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he forbi@@ ds the personnel to apply force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ ky asylum in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
young people meet at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; around 18@@ 56 ; the Kauf@@ inger Strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the allies of the Al@@ lied Forces outlined a lot of holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn tri@@ bal line took place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen group publ@@ ishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued warnings for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to get special attention when travelling by the state , as a series of question@@ able ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents will last in the whole country and be noted here , &quot; says the group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the authorities of the state , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately aimed at minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no longer any gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than whit@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring che@@ wing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for mig@@ rant violations , which will contribute to further pension benefits according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U parliamentary representatives Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the CD@@ U local Association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the pi@@ voting court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals , and houses the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative market for marketing for the milk of his cows , thus Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
region@@ als come exclusively on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
since he is also the BL@@ HV president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gr@@ ass@@ land area provides a lot of work , much need to be edited using the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not run bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to support the farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be extended quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the spread @-@ area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
from the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmer and farmer it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the objective is to keep the Black Forest open .
prerequis@@ ite is the presence of the Förder@@ kul@@ isse ( which is referred to by the L@@ PR ) .
in addition , the enclosed area may not be til@@ pper@@ y ( slope of 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , are currently in charge of the f@@ isher &apos;s f@@ aint fishing project in 2018 .
the coverage area is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House from Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically limit the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have liked him if he had done it .
but he tac@@ kl@@ ed its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta p@@ imp@@ ed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem on which you relate , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stir@@ ring words , the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ eds , your poor , and your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely , and the el@@ usive waste of your rich coastline . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they made a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus did change the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and at all a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever like to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch is not to illumin@@ ate the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black dresses Scottish members of the United Kingdom Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s field of athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championships team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special has developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with her fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ dles , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gr@@ otto that one should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also compete with the medals and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows just how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
concerning my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block cre@@ tics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t toler@@ ate the Uni@@ xes of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he imp@@ lied in the criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained that this was the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s headquarters dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rig@@ orous compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means of combining with vot@@ ers and playing his hair @-@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
hence , the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who are sw@@ inging the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea either , when a number of people take positions on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as noted by the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff as &quot; concentrated anti @-@ spam offensive , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials and to arrest or silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happened digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County posted the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it shouldn &apos;t be that hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the internet .
the number of papers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous po@@ ach@@ ograph@@ ers hit his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Am@@ ity Treaty , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project &apos;s online papers .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that really feels really special , &quot; said the resident of South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer through passi@@ vation
fewer and fewer people have died in lung cancer during the last two decades .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the Bergh@@ of Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as underground is much hidden , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic that hin@@ ders construction work again and again represents a major problem for the construction site of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she uses no cooker .
it even seldom uses a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ disturbed Indones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she doesn &apos;t have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband was not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ ring up for independence against Dutch rule , swi@@ ft@@ ly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ is and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrug@@ ated iron roofs , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust .
only very few Indones@@ ian have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans learned a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vibrant , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat .
&quot; we used only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was worth $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a sti@@ cking presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tort@@ ured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal lands in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide under the Asia Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Will Pro@@ ulate Every@@ thing &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied as Pap@@ u@@ as resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market more che@@ cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the indigenous Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken because we voted for Jok@@ sh@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash of their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their guns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said victims and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus , Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set alight , and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ i@@ tier@@ ously - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military out@@ posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official TIME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he TIME was on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many don@@ esi@@ ans bears only one name , TIME in a dark mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters told that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came until the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 to set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism to resolve historical violations of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jak@@ arta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
said the UN has accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here have been delivered quickly , such the TIME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and to withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ balance for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbit@@ rar@@ ily det@@ ained , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flights to the Nab@@ is airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to them for fil@@ ming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ even east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six p@@ acific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically supported the OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited Y@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May , the locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua says that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Gover@@ ning Council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ bo@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sh@@ uss@@ ites made a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the victim of an victim was buried in a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire seized the &quot; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that has been swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one is acci@@ dentally called the tor@@ ch tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were fighting fire at 4.00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that she is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident may re@@ vit@@ alise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup Individual was not only supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup Individual .
the often very long , but also therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics remain in the traditional competition thus obtained .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the finale at a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers will bring hi@@ bi@@ ous items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent were deliberately or deliberately banned items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent that entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally carried out@@ laid knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had delayed that they were mis@@ erable with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted by more than 1,000 people - a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out - even confirmed that younger travellers would rather dis@@ respect the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , who admitted they had kno@@ w@@ ingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X .
the most common items inten@@ tionally passing by T@@ SA agents were food@@ stuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent were willing to kno@@ w@@ ingly carry items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the air@@ plane .
the company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly brought sm@@ ug@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had inten@@ tionally done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids you are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers order order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to start with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far failed that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time revealed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : that of the cancell@@ ations at the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery commen@@ ces .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 were already with@@ drawn from the 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1,000 euros ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; fully back .
at the moment , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are currently being made , in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production site .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500@@ ,000 in 2020 , a million in 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
those who order a model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , the in@@ consistency of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA @-@ Chief P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws due to the cl@@ ause of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama @-@ era rules in order to reduce emissions @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of the state @-@ owned environmental authorities vis @-@ à @-@ vis the existing administration .
he did not mention the complaint lo@@ dged against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that took place on October 1 for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay his observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regul@@ ators , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards would simply rein@@ force the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ lment of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administration , the EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines for execution and then waited to be accused by groups of activists and others , and agreed to set an agreement on the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dates seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smoke that flows into their congreg@@ ations , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone develops when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives from public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen is celebrating 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche you will be invited to the old gra@@ vey@@ ard area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 pm to a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Martini points out : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in written documents in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ischer Registry : count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the Berg with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark &apos;s silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ ate law belonged and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as emerges from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the splendid settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 reflect these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a master , who built a church , buried and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two crushed Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed in during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the car@@ ts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm broke the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only the tower @-@ t@@ wer@@ g existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius installation by the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite the Friends and Promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16 July , for the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with ess@@ ays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the outskirts of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann addresses the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
at the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a pot@@ ion in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over pastures to the forest , &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view .
the ser@@ en@@ ade happens only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ makers .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organiz@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to appro@@ ve permission of wind turbines
Bo@@ is@@ heim hasn &apos;t seen any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has called on land rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration camp existed at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy util@@ isation for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; of the landscape .
although the city of Vier@@ sen had passed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , the district government in Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a formal error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision remains un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the gran@@ ting of approval for the establishment of wind turbines is ruled out by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has arrived at the Vier@@ sen district last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in the content of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11,@@ 400 households are to be covered - this corresponds to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households .
the NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashed : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ gel@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel with her car as a companion to her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket commodity .
accordingly , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
local companies should also present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip positions .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the campaign does not only aim at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and trade association collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city centre . &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for the Brun@@ nen@@ fest including sales so@@ jour@@ n Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ developed .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to anim@@ ate the city centre - right up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was time for King in the spring to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread in part .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; ( Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en ) day , for the first time , took part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities for the first time .
beside Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment .
two dead and one injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
at a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard .
according to the fire brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) an injured person was still in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first mistake later was also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of accidents , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline .
at the holiday season only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump set up after qu@@ en@@ ched tran@@ scripts from phone call Mexico under pressure because of payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Chief of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to declare publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president ino@@ cul@@ ated him because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . report@@ edly , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States had refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was taught by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury ran through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block their way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man wearing a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this one --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a re@@ position .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked out very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 , citizens have come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organization of ret@@ ali@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life long citizen .
for him , demand serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff lays a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none of them ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on a free stand for decades , civil rights experts say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com gave a white ground owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
but when they removed from prison and drew near to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and covered the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ oks makes it even more memorable .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , it will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has headed the annual appar@@ ition of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom wish to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we will be confronted with the ug@@ ly presence in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , van@@ ished from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire disgu@@ ises the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs lou@@ dly .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ illing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; n --- he &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was a man of the other black actors .
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; R. &apos; . &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when he says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with grief stands above the bodies of the actors and brings Bil@@ lie Holidays a gri@@ eving lob@@ b@@ ying called &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind , a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pe sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ an overwhelming moisture every nearly eight hours , when Bro@@ oks is leading her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same land , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ ds took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
kids ho@@ ck at their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember .
after a few minutes gre@@ ens would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the position with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words that had left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what you do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s courtyard at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; re@@ positioning is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf put on a multi@@ coloured and fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) displays an ab@@ rupt street corner including a Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stom@@ er &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ timer is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ bre@@ eders pose as a rock erg@@ ir@@ l , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine @-@ bre@@ eders - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - are in perfect harmony with the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
c@@ ess se@@ duc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ atter a cor@@ pse in Hollywood man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing is singing the mar@@ vel@@ ous fi@@ esen Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when Siegfried beats Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor , Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and viol@@ ently bow down to Merkel &apos;s space , will be celebrated stor@@ my .
there is great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly anticipated .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a whi@@ stling Pfei@@ f@@ concert about himself , there were five years later , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ Spe@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been glad about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has somehow grown together with the Ring , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown into an understanding of its way of view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount works as volunteer
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ niture bridge .
and I also worked on the open day at school .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ working volunteer .
how does that happen ?
amount : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see , as it is on the spot , in the focus perhaps also , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social education in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the youth @-@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in a different way than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people in front , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether an adol@@ escent who has been taken out of the family - must always be individually addressed .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that way .
Pear@@ son cr@@ ashes more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4.000 positions were lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction programme to reduce cost reduction by a further 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , shared a statement by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; carried out by people . &quot;
the statement is that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide auto@@ bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s most deadly milit@@ ant attack since the US @-@ led troops pushed T@@ ali@@ ban away from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in response to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to meet stringent air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump attempted to drive a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
the efforts , however , have triggered the bac@@ kl@@ ash of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants common room
in the end the decision was clear : in the case of two votes , the local council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to establish a common room in the future retirement residence .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will still take some time before the church community has been in the communal ownership so far , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council en@@ ites such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living , but openly entering the church .
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be decided by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a dome between the legs in this regard , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces tr@@ ump height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , be this addi@@ tive .
when it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously to the body .
it is not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a covered subsi@@ dy to any@@ how wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real exchange value , which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
according to Sta@@ BG &apos;s request to submit the proposal , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
col@@ lision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder at 12.@@ 20 am with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg had travelled from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , he apparently did not notice the traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 year old Hil@@ de@@ tian .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching carriage .
Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern is the first duty play of the new season to Dortmund .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 08.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at the Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to for@@ ego David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ ners are missing Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official pr@@ el@@ ude of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

walking in the Harz of Stern to Stern
in the Harz region , the first &quot; star trail &quot; is to be created .
this is the purpose of the club observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star trail &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was called .
it combines nature , science , exercise and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be comple@@ mented by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network welcome plays a role in selecting location .
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
later , the train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
they also learned why stars could have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it lies far more distant .
I will also teach in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 the association runs the highest situated observ@@ atory of Northern Germany in the St. Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain town .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s path since 2003 - at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planetary path with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the Sun , exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet is four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
but the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ak@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a col@@ lision course in order to put the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ bi@@ ased World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing organization Super fe@@ ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s win by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ak@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos Lom@@ ak@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on light weight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ak@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their Light@@ weight cover fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed frank@@ ly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ak@@ enko considered the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks that the triple @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after a tire burst
on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost its control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ ried to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Br@@ uns@@ wick to point out the optimisation of the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result even if there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to work better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ chain should also be further optimised .
and the run@@ es don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the tri@@ chain , even after the experiences in preparation .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is certain of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the tri@@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build good things , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mal@@ ted start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing of that .
&quot; I only leave the start into the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim was forced to ab@@ ort pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion of as@@ cen@@ sion in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 % where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday take part in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Authority ( S@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum process , you should make more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , migration sales have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency maintained the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correctly judged as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proce@@ eding well .
on Wednesday , a heavy concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road and Transport in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began simultaneously on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Light@@ weight is certain that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red colored sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly moderni@@ zed .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red colored sand@@ stone .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
on Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received a 30 @-@ metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge can@@ opy on the north side on the north side .
this is a border for@@ ging , which is also used as an operational route .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way was to run .
the special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ tip @-@ sensation has the laying of lines required by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished initially .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pasture towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the cost of the three bridge alloys amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under one hat .
the parties represented in the power day of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a wide alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell is inviting &quot; large election campaign opening &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ developers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum One World and one of the decisive organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us Church there were not enough parking places available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the audi@@ t@@ orium there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now , the police had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D @-@ Event , the guests at the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a rer@@ e@@ tion with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian Tr@@ ump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo tromb@@ on@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two as in a new outfit , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz performer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games combine to become an intri@@ gu@@ ing artwork .
this key part of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparently most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt very bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin affir@@ ms the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I had dat@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it never conf@@ uses me or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to look for a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns carbon mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party , which would rather prevent us from working in order to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of Athletics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian track leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the sport of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who won gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comment@@ aries , the IA@@ AF @-@ Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban pending in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e to the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships , starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still working freely , he said rep@@ orters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .
a F@@ uner@@ al act for soldiers cut off in Mali
at a fun@@ eral service in the Northern H@@ ess@@ ischen F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city with high security measures .
the Minister for Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ solved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pilots , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts in their field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this supreme sacrifice provided by the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought to St. Peter &apos;s F@@ ritz@@ lar Cathedral on Thursday .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German armed forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
sad@@ dens lay down roses , the relatives were arms in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen indicated the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rod sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
he shared the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , she said further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the reign of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also highlighted the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the editor of the Danish royal house , declared .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ pez@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , met in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard time in his almost 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk we@@ as@@ ms instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , whom I smoke in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the Parliament &apos;s resolution was pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the presidential election , the red @-@ green coalition lost their scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament with the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ westen ( former Green Party ) established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to include them .
this meant that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the Red @-@ Green State Government should now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Parliament decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament el@@ ects trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step , &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens urged the opposition MPs to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have immediate effect on their country mandate that has received them from the Green State List , &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to introduce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the resig@@ nation of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason to vot@@ ers but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the Austr@@ asse T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
in her last vanity and fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian places her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; said SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this fil@@ thy intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen@@ sens CD@@ U Group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country &apos;s election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD at that time , but SPD and Gre@@ ens had a w@@ afer @-@ thin majority from one voice in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxins , Mr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to carefully check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of is a health haz@@ ard practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now assume the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned off and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade as well as manufacturers ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and safe to health .
if the resi@@ due content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able .
however , un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time there are not the farms to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , production companies do not have immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the incident .
is it missing only at the staff or at the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be received is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers and consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ ghtly indig@@ nant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ elled means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this has to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are quickly and seam@@ lessly solved .
how the financial rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access@@ ing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules that were launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to extract Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that Ne@@ y@@ mar sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the rich host family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to counter legitimate revenue sources , which allow them to break even a break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini at his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pur@@ suit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P trial period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ su@@ ade from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years amounts to 44.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members of the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might attempt to over@@ list their financial supervision by blo@@ wing their income through companies tied to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ isches company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship exceeds the standard market rate , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar could come about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 cont@@ ested that Ne@@ y@@ mar will become World Cup Ambassador and could easily find such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to keep in mind any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a bo@@ on for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar last owner of PS@@ G .
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gia supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order an@@ ew .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged panels of 14 grams will distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers each year prior to landing .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ der estimates the order volume according to &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a g@@ og@@ gy manufacturer .
Swiss will not be able to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new call for ten@@ ders .
in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
chocolate bars distribute Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
prior to joining a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of the First Class will be p@@ am@@ pered by conf@@ ection@@ eries of the fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in business class washing passengers Sc@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short @-@ circuit Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that were spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by divi@@ ding to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play dirty children who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the pedi@@ ment principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point , a character en@@ chan@@ ts by an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of Sing@@ les , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy .
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise such as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a fabri@@ c@@ ating producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police are spending the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick tail@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a decent game &apos; Find the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
in six long epis@@ odes , it pul@@ ls itself away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited for a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef must always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that the Western culture can make everything for food for a subsi@@ dy .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious roman@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the Country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and were already arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and hundreds of thousands of euros .
two persons were arrested during the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 police officers were in use .
the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drug crimes , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating const@@ ancy against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big insert was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigation , Italian citizens with close ties to the Italian Maf@@ ia came to the fore .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
fashion acc@@ uses large gaps in the For@@ eig@@ ner Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out a media report on large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present .
according to the regi@@ sters , there are estimated ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in statistics on exit @-@ paying people , EU citizens are also recorded who wouldn &apos;t have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assignments led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with the exit to exit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has obviously started sending refugees back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have arrived from there .
this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
according to the paper , this means that BA@@ MF performing such procedures on families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - returned to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for the refugees of the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the travelling country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy delivered guarantees for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also return refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand fraction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening un@@ lawful admission conditions and a endanger@@ ment of child lives because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation is celebrating several times of willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it &apos;s in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the county director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their components .
for example , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reports about the activities carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change into the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter passed away ten times each 500 milliliter of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth weak@@ ened support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alled that in the coming years , interest increases would be necessary in order to raise the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package published a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with £ 115 billion .
after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank emphas@@ ised however that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank for this and next year adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast projected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision not to change after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rise in interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the ti@@ ghtening first becomes worse before it becomes better .
she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent &quot; the collapse of earnings in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages would be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this has been expected and will be attra@@ cting them again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % is &quot; wholly &quot; to the weak pound .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent s@@ wap rate decline , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become stronger again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks very good for those with whom the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages shut down , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now available from the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was welcomed as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) designated it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to permit the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ Ex@@ posi@@ tional Pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p to take prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will cost £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to evaluate the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as it is used on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England in order to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt will take us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , was res@@ ized in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurb@@ ished .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage and an mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to pick us up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the top or bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel rein@@ forcement , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that if you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage box , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high quality materials , giving the room its luxurious edge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that will help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of somewhat standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave them .
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate agent
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation because of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ alis@@ ms of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and Develop@@ er Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and assets are to be shared .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co family founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a judicial record says that Col@@ in property is owned by $ 316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought of the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to have ruled out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but rather thro@@ ws Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some pos@@ sessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in asser@@ ting that Mark had paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s new chief of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wants to repair : poor information falling into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnos@@ es makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February of Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit under control according to six former electoral campaigns consists in ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s twe@@ ets could contain even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him for several times , their efforts were worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House assembled from competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - wholly occupied with this story - reported in May about the predi@@ le@@ ction of the advis@@ ors to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and to figure out where they come from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone vi@@ vi@@ ously gave a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump is receiving . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be requested and hoped .
in this summer the police all over Europe send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences showed that many cur@@ sory stops were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the web page ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ entation , more than 2.5 million times this was viewed .
36 of the online visitors could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the base of the war , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn from the church in order to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street called Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch carved by the Council in order to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the def@@ ences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must indeed be forced by Sch@@ am to implement it , as he was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ bil@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of proof , it is very important that as many local residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by calling on 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birk@@ enhof company by the then Ambiente GmbH mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 over@@ nights per year were lost and revenues by the tourist tax were also lost .
in the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a gathering shelter for the administrative office , which meant controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was un@@ disp@@ uted in the municipal council .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the building .
he was right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house in the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s Palace .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof stand in front of the entrance since a long time , and when one enters the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
the swimming pool , the spa and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual guests , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director Michael Kr@@ ause as Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under a million Euros he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the fore , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ates Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the panel has taken up the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter .
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the sender CN@@ N reported that there were already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was agreement between Tr@@ ump@@ et Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps as a private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump in person has moved to the centre and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test the present evidence in possible break@@ through@@ s and decide whether it is alleged to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Trial Cham@@ bers .
they are mostly switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office in order to pre @-@ charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , inv@@ itations were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ ump counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his then chief election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the interview .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment would show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the approval of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the demo@@ crats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but he usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the Sonder@@ ager on &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed since it was explained in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after he had fired Com@@ ey .
because of this root repro@@ ach , alle@@ g@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he ob@@ struc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after presenting US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ promot@@ er and its staff .
the qu@@ en@@ ched spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump mu@@ eller is going to release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft bill on Thursday after which the Sonder@@ promot@@ er could no longer be dismis@@ sed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened itself from the Shel@@ f .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs about one tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research , the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the ice age is un@@ clear .
however , in the past 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice @-@ tu@@ fts in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the Kol@@ oss , which is now broken , has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of waxing and breaking off some years ago was disturbed .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some talk about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece of water is broken down at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been a lot of ice caps in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the drop in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has grown by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is counting on the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants a house rate at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls for withdrawal from the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs have penet@@ rated the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first day of work .
the teachers in the circle are obviously highly cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
however , the circle is still lacking in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann &apos;s circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage , that is to say .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , to demonstrate concrete measures for entry @-@ level entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech is from a down@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who reti@@ re from the service due to illness or age .
so high time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
already in the day of the circle he made a big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cover and start@@ led the remaining parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked which allow withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not arrive at a satisfying solution at short notice , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ related towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; said nations .
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees tari@@ ffs for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly mandatory , increases or more money is only available when you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees were concerned with the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to deplo@@ y li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively worked with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in detailed examples of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew will board the ding@@ hy migrants , who are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the records of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not carry any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization is Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim in hot summer temperatures .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for the long trium@@ phs rewarded .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Party saus@@ age market .
again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , a lot of altitude metres were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers have inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also approached .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters in altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga supports E @-@ Sport
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting for wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
these have also recognized the first federal states involved increasingly in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and most recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board , Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA will be fought at competitive level .
as in normal sports , li@@ ges have long since established themselves , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certain to get used to .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , e @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competitive and has many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but there are also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls were difficult to carry out in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports failed .
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integ@@ rative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years .
although the soccer league is almost 2.4 billion euros , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an E @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company in the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot hold on to the fact that only football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter con@@ vic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy push for suicide
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was con@@ vic@@ ted in June because of a neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
clothed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward @-@ looking eyes when she was con@@ vic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has not shown regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jud@@ ge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no day where I don &apos;t bed the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will bear for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding , or that she would be an aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been together with since my birth is a pain I will keep for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts that makes it a crime to impose another , commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop on a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter wanted to draw attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder by her British fellow resident in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not imprisonment . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ond : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is no accident .
Bayern Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ond immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen , he made his arm tied to him .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavaria captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was also able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al had been chosen as a hand@@ ler in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had come from youth , but he was chosen as a hand@@ ler .
sugar @-@ l is most prefer@@ able to those of whom one has a lot of herbs that one wants to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to join the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can use a small extra motivation only .
Kim@@ ber affir@@ med : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ki@@ cked off the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ m .
right behind , that &apos;s its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ i worked at all in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view to the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vid@@ al would like to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( hardly worked out ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che means to get on with the services of the Asia trip ( also just condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ atively impact their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s jer@@ sey .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted sover@@ eign@@ ly .
the n@@ ol@@ ly occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried successfully in the game @-@ building a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result &quot; was not the way we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in her debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one sees in the connection to the game .
for example , Rud@@ y did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ond passed a few cr@@ ump@@ y statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you simply have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB @-@ Damen
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ FB ladies
Austria &apos;s well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has announced himself shortly before the game on Twitter and wished the Ö@@ FB ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary is practically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ au@@ beck and fe@@ bert with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
perhaps our ladies might well need the famous Bavaria shower .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Grü@@ ne ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V requests from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , President of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the needs of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the A1 motorway between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is expected to be construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western enclosure of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
as from Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) tries to obtain a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that has been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts need to be created quickly , at the same time missing the land at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
until now , there are only 29 jobs from 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing in the countryside .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting station ; the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of regional roads .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a rating of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stag@@ gering internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she had already cleared the field for in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ president said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options in terms of driving constraints , &quot; and was referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - forbi@@ d@@ ding or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ Benz vehicles modified in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alising diesel @-@ driven exhaust gases also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of viol@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested , but can be tra@@ ced back to normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer proudly contributes to the winning of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the introduc@@ tory statement wants to elu@@ ci@@ date .
on the raft you see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a mil@@ ler mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a worthy game flow .
last summer the raft sail@@ ed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Del@@ ete @-@ nos@@ es and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the buttons of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he hit himself among other things as dra@@ fts@@ man for greetings cards - which fru@@ strated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , his breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
the artist was always inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .

la@@ ven@@ der in Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught and because of the diseases transmitted insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant heads with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and slo@@ wing down the ev@@ ap@@ oration out of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year .
the anchor point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ pers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a rural house camp should be able to experience these days in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines Mexico &apos;s growing threat
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sia usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office that was the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from the violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is her editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; writes Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ o building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely put to trial .
in Ri@@ odo@@ sia , however , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to discussing security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we are str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sia in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there &apos;s practically nothing but silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day one or more people are shot down on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug king@@ doms , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gangs purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper publishing the same story , leaving the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without pushing for the drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time the newspaper deser@@ ved a reputation because of bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ orters preferred to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dar@@ ed to handle otherwise .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it was .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you as journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there on the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ya Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in a joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen whom the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , odo@@ sia has li@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a expos@@ é to government spending concent@@ rating on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; escaped a military raid .
just a few months earlier , the readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , turned around because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by posting in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying and killing journalists because they said the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re@@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces hiding under a ceiling with the organized crime .
last year , the media fan group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note suppos@@ edly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana did in 2004 by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the D@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , ad@@ mits that the drug trade is fri@@ ghtening him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones started to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ sia on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens ho@@ wling nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
among the mighty portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her for reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that its sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the ancest@@ ral ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ ri@@ ers who lived in the middle of the ret@@ ac@@ ing time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has been aston@@ ished by researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the file discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy crude oil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ op@@ ing technique that is known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to move better into his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of the bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond that of the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were ch@@ ased by enough pressure through carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than lo@@ ot , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong carni@@ v@@ ore behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors of the ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on po@@ inters on his life , including his preserved Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Flo@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cir@@ cling time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you &apos;re just chat@@ ting a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the ret@@ ac@@ ing time was a time when huge baths , carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he entered the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s ancest@@ ral ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was washed by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater re@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our exquisite in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ fi@@ sts still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of maintenance is &apos; rare as winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
fos@@ sili@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
its right front foot rests on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles have been involved in a mass bal@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long st@@ ume and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police there were about 5 p.m. between the jun@@ ctions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( the district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ sec@@ ted .
first of all , there are no information on the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of driving in Munich , a back @-@ up of about ten kilometres was formed .
as a AZ Rep@@ orter has reported , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle manufacturers , which now have to count on delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a col@@ lision between a car transport orter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and just have an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and aw@@ akes one uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ value your ticket .
a test operation is currently underway on two routes .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it .
it will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a rail speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; takes the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor .
to be able to use this , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
you also have to have access to the train , DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , a seat reservation is needed .
for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
at the test customers a button for electronic evaluation appears .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating place Y .
if the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at ticket control at place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep quiet .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ d@@ ants checked in the DB Navig@@ ator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their journey time more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Remote Management Board Member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents needed to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , leading to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections between ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Bri@@ de sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police killed just a 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ av@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis area was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she picked her cell phone to go back to the Can@@ field Drive in the evening in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people sh@@ outing , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the super@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened during the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and of protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance that is made up of people &apos;s eyes and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter who carried a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of ... what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has to know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves .
even though I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of ac@@ tivis@@ m began to take on for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m has totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congreg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
Fer@@ rel@@ l came to mind a question : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals was the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after black@@ out shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people will be presented , for so I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to concentrate on Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman there is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
she still sticks to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ reader discussing bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been divi@@ ding the population into advoc@@ ates and enemies since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery said : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery is attra@@ cting more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work it will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been in the market hall almost every week for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ ids are always very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also cities in other cities .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , pay attention to the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is reasonably priced .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rent there are often non @-@ portable to a retail@@ er .
too bad , special deals almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not suit Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s no need to buy a shopping center that &apos;s empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ anders and Haar@@ lem , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after making public diplomatic noti@@ fications publicly available on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 counts including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ shirt , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg joined the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts , such as cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became an un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ ler , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; supp@@ ressed images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform Leg@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ ers@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endo@@ wed with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ths of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides in the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , all of us are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with you is that our gen@@ ome will not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ ouses Mem@@ ories , are also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone from the discipline of discipline of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they let your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as fores@@ ighted in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , from its own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which assemble themselves as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed in Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , the acts of the County Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ vings .
a Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the scene of the event , and Det@@ ec@@ tives insp@@ ect the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively sought the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ indig@@ o , Vice President of University Rel@@ ation@@ ships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that he had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ic@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that both lan@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ implementation of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t include anything that could cause Russia to worry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in public subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one pre@@ clu@@ des to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
Rus@@ ada was eliminated in November 2015 in the wake of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that Rus@@ ada was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .

from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ene anti @-@ lice .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next buyer
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to check the luck with your e @-@ commerce startup , but the pol@@ ls didn &apos;t work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed .
she called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent C @-@ Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the finance @-@ technical Web site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
it has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line , which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Lem@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its employees treat poor@@ ly or behave in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ ts , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Conver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practice .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent are offering your software as a service , and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a firm do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you will not follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who is now carrying out monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate actions the same day if a problem was reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so saved .
and after gathering feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always gain new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the water man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the player &apos;s burden , and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the fry shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises .
they should keep up with 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal play preparations for their ki@@ cking off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change in rules even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed through , they plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which , in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with pe@@ dest@@ als , will not be an easy task .
break @-@ ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on car park 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible fal@@ seh@@ ood and send them to factor reviews that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful messages like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new Fac@@ ts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual reviews will be challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb impression on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his thumb impression !
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greetings a little &quot; ) , this all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gar@@ den@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ ers who hid Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l depic@@ ts his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made until years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be a dre@@ am@@ ers , always paying debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men dissolved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ lady . &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his deployment in the castle .
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ ä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inaugur@@ ation of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there should be a feast on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write their website on their website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , it stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
as well this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the discussions .
this led to the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS in the number of survi@@ vors .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been de@@ posed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ il Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt .
against 48@@ 6 people , who have been involved in the coup attempt , is being negoti@@ ated in Ankara this week .
on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; given that he had given him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale building in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 civilian servants by decree , 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the masters of the country .
three times they called upon their role as sent@@ in@@ els of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was forced to take the helm of the military step by step , not least with reference to the reform directives of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer named after the attempted coup in fear of persecution in foreign countries warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is a doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army &apos;s readiness for action .
the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US Immig@@ ration Plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , strict rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by giving the US the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by American media .
Ministry wants route for shuttle shuttle
again and again over the past few months the future of the race belt has been disp@@ uted - now it &apos;s going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the marble stretch on which the tourist train drives .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works on the track will begin this year in order to secure the future of the race trailer in the long term .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection , &quot; explained Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of over@@ hau@@ l the route was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country assumes 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , is currently being voted defini@@ tively , said S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thur@@ ing@@ ia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
as a result , the race @-@ gate shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the race @-@ gate shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , it has been tested whether the circuit is being used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partly cloudy in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more common , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a st@@ eppe @-@ woman would look progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed into robots with a silicone membrane .
for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed celeb@@ ri@@ ties such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape when one takes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most .
on its website compared True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something Dun@@ kl@@ ess and lowering in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men , of course , will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their increasing popularity , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what is perme@@ ated from the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly evolved sex robots come up in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; Der Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the closed body and the raised eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background story , nothing hin@@ ting independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the expressions of 2017 : ma@@ ids
sl@@ umps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US vot@@ ers have also split families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all going to rig@@ or@@ ously strive to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power tr@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side .
it is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by a tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ ky way that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t be rep@@ ul@@ sed .
there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; who suddenly appear to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild pen@@ al .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park division , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals rotate in order to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ sparkling music communic@@ ates this in a curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the central park car@@ ou@@ sel , however , is still a curious magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to review my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
in the past year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , enjoying them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he kept his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Far@@ mer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the quad@@ rant pupils from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
at Tuesday evening Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the release , the 29 students of the four classes voted under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle that grew up in the chicken yard , but then released into the freedom .
on top of that , the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it hat@@ ched by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of chicken we@@ ens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken , and the eagle made his wings wide on a high mountain .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders wore to the toilet .
the eagle stands for the integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ t@@ eller to feel accepted in his new school .
there followed a letter of thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who again and again came up with class@@ room pas@@ sports , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the coast time is over , class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared .
after two years of teaching , she only un@@ ra@@ vels her students , because it was a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the four @-@ door chan@@ gers .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ class vehicles have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal tents was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp and impose significant fin@@ es on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people concerned now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
the aim is to improve the emission performance of Euro 5 emissions classes and Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negoti@@ ated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have become the che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Environment Agency ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to any affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long should the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
this depends on the company &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es you to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would re@@ dress so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a threat of a massive price deteri@@ oration of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving pro@@ hi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
up to now , there is no loss of value for older dies@@ els in rural areas .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year , as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced his intention to refra@@ in from attending the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burden me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify her views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but adequate applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a member of the town for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he im@@ parts in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time to famili@@ ari@@ ze with the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub@@ contracting authority for the administrative community , the applicant must point out corresponding agreements .
because this function intends to keep the city in any event .
if she would not be able to fill this out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it , &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good sen@@ timent between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Bol@@ l@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium rehabilitation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will be@@ ech about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a great scope for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and nur@@ sery production can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands under monument protection as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is fitting , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring urban master builder empha@@ sizes .
in any case , the City Buil@@ der bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going on here above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of support and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , after information from the city of Has@@ lach you should have a completed degree course as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ construction matters , administration of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening services as well as underground building rights authority including monument protection .
bike thrown on leads : southern railway track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the crime scene , a car driver and a bike rider were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators themselves would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delayed minutes and the costs for rail freight transport , P@@ ön@@ ders of the railway customers could also face the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without any disabilities .
just under ten personal trains , Friday morning had failed , two of them were connected by correspondence .
freight trains did not drop , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the UK , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissue .
if the balance tends too far towards the inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments we found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han is toler@@ ant of toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system works in people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe which was separated from that which had not had .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers allowed L reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component has been puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. cru@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic had been exp@@ elled from the pro@@ vision@@ ing Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho made that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started at the Avi@@ va stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho made its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho made three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get three out of four , I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and pulled himself in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had already made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern about elections .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch with growing horror the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were precip@@ itations .
one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unexpected release of a Green party has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the presidential election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority in the CD@@ U and F@@ DP opposition .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding low @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Democ@@ rat Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
El@@ ke T@@ westen needs to return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Executive and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD election campaign when the new hi@@ bal message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , former Minister @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , did the comrades calm down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and that was the case - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smoothly .
in the weeks after that , comrades re@@ b@@ elled .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD in the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communications he did everything wrong after that , which can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW emission standards and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him grant him , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal pressures of the Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger focuses on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliament@@ ar@@ ist T@@ westen .
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen places her own car@@ eers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary faction , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ er ow@@ l four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties counter@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann further said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding fees for local people III
those who want to be able to renov@@ ate their homes will soon be able to get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EG &apos;s urban development were informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened to date .
since 1991 , there have been san@@ itation areas in sens@@ ations .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had acquired two thirds of the funding amount .
in the area of refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , amoun@@ ting to 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the commun@@ e of sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if necessary , the area limits could then shift again .
the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out .
core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as stat@@ ute .
the period of approval for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to receive a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December , the statutes aim to take place as soon as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the proposed preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating the conditions of urban development and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow fac@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; Building and Land Cur@@ ve , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation intentions .
in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing bows , &quot; information on size , division and residents of a residential area may be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; worked - those who first come , first gr@@ ind .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later .
finally , some photos of the project &quot; Plac@@ ement II &quot; were shown to make a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation to those present .
British invent@@ or himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ the@@ tist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ cons@@ in fire@@ man car and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi for@@ klift .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its super@@ visor , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on 17 July in the morning at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the grass was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew should be required for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours .
the original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by the TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event the president gave a push for the reform of the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is unlikely to be a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump performed an investigation in February when the presidential air@@ plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet due to its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the &quot; Made In America &quot; show - the products from all 50 countries that are made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a Sik@@ or@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company had not been involved in issu@@ ing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ab@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump interven@@ ed with the helicopter when he saw his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss on challenging task
the championship leader of the Second World League is the championship leader Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC @-@ Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss arrives at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ amm Su@@ chs@@ dorfer beach tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel .
despite having played a fla@@ w@@ less balance after five games , the top rider of the Second World League has retained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for the class and stability of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer beach , especially imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ os ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need a good dose of luck . &quot;

how America the O@@ MV can harm
but Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress passed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft seems to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then investors have been al@@ armed by domestic O@@ MV , who jointly with other European firms contributed to the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to impose even the sanctions by Executive Order .
twelve arms are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer un@@ veiled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .

roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal nur@@ sery , the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal nur@@ sery schools ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ control .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking continues outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers refriger@@ ated fresh water .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand steadily increases .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating in the day@@ care centre , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away the food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a gar@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen staff members now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for it is also about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen @-@ forces - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has shown itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economical means it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says UNO
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ sho@@ m , senior leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be able to run in the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the T@@ ali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year elections for the first time will be handed over to power peac@@ efully by a democra@@ tically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ sho@@ m said a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to make a long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow in the case of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investment at the Tol@@ l@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work at the factory , which besides other products Hob@@ s@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Kek@@ se produces cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; express concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ iz@@ ers Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross from the General @-@ Site @-@ Manager concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labor forces concentrate strongly on the local community and the Gre@@ ater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al Manager at Tol@@ l@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and G@@ MB representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and that is true for all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site full and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issu@@ ing a £ 189 million offer to trigger his release cl@@ ause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record assault ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returns to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ an Board is insi@@ sting that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to subscribe to one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G middle @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ y@@ mar .
roller revers@@ ed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator deliberately turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 , and thus caused a damage of over 200 euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for advice .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and touched the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane , so he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver touched the crash barrier in the process .
Sach@@ sen@@ hausen was created on the passenger car .
the driver of the forth@@ coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mercedes @-@ Benz driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au with Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report lists Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use falls reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German Press Agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the director of St. Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother .
it would greatly benefit the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that reporting about violence in the domains of the Cathedral was measured with &quot; two measures . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ afa , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; the habit of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ pon@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a m@@ ess feeding . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows were a very normal educational means &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
they find it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , for the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the ab@@ uses , pop@@ e Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written by R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the attorney Ulrich Weber who was instruc@@ ted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
in total 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. uses forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims judge the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the Final Report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence in the gen@@ ders &quot; of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was pal@@ p@@ ably pal@@ p@@ able when a domain kit had no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one makes the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask oneself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he is specifically dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside its sphere of influence .
at best , one can repro@@ ach him , of which too late or first hints are not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent certificate , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who fed the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always moved from children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ aining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has also led to break@@ down@@ s .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ co@@ wards and too che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually happens in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders if it is not with his public@@ ity and his role as Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s brother , that many media threw himself on him straight .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously .
but the truth is : the report lists Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media reported a lot about the issue of abuse among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in the media .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also subjected to any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; said an officer representing others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who , in a professional sense , would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it like this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is rep@@ uted to him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clear@@ er or even more open than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to relate his good name to these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
namely , it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let us say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ri@@ ght@@ fully ch@@ ed@@ ged and mal@@ toler@@ ated and suffered , all of them occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this , like most witnesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what else was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with whom the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. &quot; and therefore , in numerous cases , even in spite of violence , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
thus , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which the states were reported to him at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
did George R@@ atz@@ inger consistently dev@@ our ears before the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the preliminary school the punishment would continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penetration .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as inspec@@ tors were also banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us knows well .
it was also difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princ@@ ess is right .
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what has been broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent child souls , that goes far beyond that of that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear @-@ co@@ wards and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , it kept strictly against it .
what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger published in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject exam@@ iner also available in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Cathedral spar@@ rows played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all admit that he was carrying a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism without the challenge of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ class nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , real cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t even get a big singer from stub@@ born boys and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
as what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ faith , deep @-@ faith and heart @-@ hear@@ ted people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something too much for a fly .
I get regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ gement , regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has brought them the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and which they almost worship .
and please , once again , clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is extremely un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , all too obvious .
the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the start @-@ up would be , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps nobody of Germany would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
