<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youths should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being excavated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners are cultivating the rusty ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official card promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, who had to get upset already, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but especially therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickboard carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called original papers, were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische glorification administration between 1810 and 1864 and arose from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon summed up an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9th, 1801, the present neighbours, who created the idea of a region-wide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph progressed the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian State Measurement Management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original document for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears to be relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, in the year 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastien Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "original photo" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today small plots do not show farmers any more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the field of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height of "On the Ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once blocked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt was created "On the Auer Lüfte."</seg>
<seg id="34">Starting in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and for example ended the banqueting of the so-called Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to apply force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalky asylum in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "main square" around 1856; the Kaufinger Strasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the allies of the Allied Forces outlined a lot of holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn tribal line took place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued warnings for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racial attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to get special attention when travelling by the state, as a series of questionable racial-based incidents will last in the whole country and be noted here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the authorities of the state, disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer any gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for migrant violations, which will contribute to further pension benefits according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidecaun project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentary representatives Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the CDU local Association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the pivoting court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals, and houses the Feriengäste in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is for him the alternative market for marketing for the milk of his cows, thus Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionals come exclusively on the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "elementary important."</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot generate profitably on such steep areas." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, much need to be edited using the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "" "" "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to support the farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could be extended quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The spread-area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmer and farmer it doesn't work." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also for Peter Weiß," "" "" "" "best foods are produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of the Förderkulisse (which is referred to by the LPR).</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area may not be tilppery (slope of 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">Eight participants with 24 parcels, who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, are currently in charge of the fisher's faint fishing project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The coverage area is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House from Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically limit the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he tackled its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta pimped: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "" "" "the poem on which you relate, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weeds, your poor, and your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely, and the elusive waste of your rich coastline."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they made a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus did change the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the world around: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and at all a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's field of athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championships team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their Captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with her fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says it's "incredible," that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir carries on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another grotto that one should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also compete with the medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block cretics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the Unixes of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He implied in the criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "in 1783, Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained that this was the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's headquarters dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "" "" "said many people." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rigorous compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means of combining with voters and playing his hair-less head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence, the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are swinging the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take positions on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">As noted by the Governor's staff as "concentrated anti-spam offensive," others would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It shouldn't be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous poachographers hit his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="250">In their wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the undisturbed Indonesian province Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour the salted tuber is taken out with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.</seg>

<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 5pm," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, stirring up for independence against Dutch rule, swiftly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal monitors.</seg>

<seg id="275">A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade from the territory.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an imbalance for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by pushing sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as a "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty alleviates dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: mainly nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women, each with four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flights to the Nabis airport.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Board of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission was given to them for filming.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokov's campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's uneven easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papua." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including Paniai shootings.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the accusations of the Group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights ambassadors Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited Yayapura on 4th May, the locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that took part in the session, but would remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says that they probably won't vote for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai Kisses," says Gobai, Chairman of the Governing Council.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from being living under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobi says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokboi as a "guilt" that he must pay back.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai-Shussites made a final symbolic act of defiance: the victim of an victim was buried in a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They know they will never give justice to them, but at least they will not forget their crimes.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent were deliberately or deliberately banned items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent that entered the plane while they accidentally carried outlaid knives or other objects with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they had delayed that they were miserable with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey was conducted by more than 1,000 people - a jet-charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., carried out - even confirmed that younger travellers would rather disrespect the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed, who admitted they had knowingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, were 19.7 percent millennials compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items intentionally passing by TSA agents were foodstuffs and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent were willing to knowingly carry items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the airplane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done it.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that the people who are most likely smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who fly most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company indicates that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure which fluids you are allowed to take with or how much of it.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk doesn't matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers order order</seg>
<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to start with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far failed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk for the first time revealed another, less glittering figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: that of the cancellations at the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In the past few months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery commences.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 were already withdrawn from the 518.000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1,000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" fully back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment, 455.000 of such non-binding reservations are currently being made, in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models should be combined - 500,000 in 2020, a million in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA-Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the clause of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules in order to reduce emissions-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of the state-owned environmental authorities vis-à-vis the existing administration.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about a deadline that took place on October 1 for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay his observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulators, which resists the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA steward exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards would simply reinforce the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under earlier administration, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for execution and then waited to be accused by groups of activists and others, and agreed to set an agreement on the implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take dates seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA statement that Pruitt will eventually use his "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the provisions are based on a sound policy and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been set to vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smoke that flows into their congregations," said Schneiderman.</seg>
<seg id="459">New York closed in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="461">The resulting smog may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths.</seg>
<seg id="462">Representatives from public health care and environmentalists cheered on Pruitts's surprising change of course.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche you will be invited to the old graveyard area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 pm to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini points out: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in written documents in the Württembergischer Registry: count Hermann von Sulz "sold the Berg with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark's silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or patronate law belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As emerges from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the splendid settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 reflect these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master, who built a church, buried and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greater of the two crushed Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be handed in during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the carts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm broke the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-twerg existing today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius installation by the "creative retirees" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite the Friends and Promoters Tumlingens to the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July, for the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The outskirts of Hartmut Romann addresses the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, there is a potion in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over pastures to the forest," the organizers provide the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade happens only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumors and hearing-makers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to approve permission of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">Boisheim hasn't seen any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim," has called on land rat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration camp existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had passed a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, the district government in Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a formal error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision remains unlawful and therefore also to be taken back," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of Boisheim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "this is where the granting of approval for the establishment of wind turbines is ruled out by law." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the corresponding letter has arrived at the Viersen district last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households are to be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="531">City and dealer plan "home shopping" weekend</seg>
<seg id="532">Bad Langensalzberg and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice inhabitants to shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers for what offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">Accordingly, there is a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">Local companies should also present themselves with their apprenticeship positions.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The campaign does not only aim at residents of the city and the surrounding region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">City administration and trade association collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">In this way, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">These include new offerings such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest including sales sojourn Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-developed.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to animate the city centre - right up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was time for King in the spring to overcome the lethargy with a network that had spread in part.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "Heimat-Shoppen" (Heimat-Shoppen) day, for the first time, took part in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="564">Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Chief of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="565">On January 27, Trump called for a telephone call with the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto to declare publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.</seg>
<seg id="566">The US president inoculated him because he denounced the wall publicly. reportedly, he said to him: "you cannot tell the press."</seg>

<seg id="568">Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States had refugees who emigrated to Australia, "ridiculous," "mies" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was taught by the Obama administration would look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the US.</seg>

<seg id="571">Moores Ford massacre: activists perform racist Lynchact as a call for justice</seg>
<seg id="572">A 1948-spec Ford Mercury ran through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with rifles to block their way.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man wearing a pinstriped suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.</seg>

<seg id="581">Since 2005, citizens have come back to the Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one ever was charged with murder.</seg>

<seg id="589">A bailiff lays a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.</seg>
<seg id="591">But none of them ever was charged.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain on a free stand for decades, civil rights experts say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="594">Approximately at the same time as the choice, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom gave a white ground owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, such as the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey into prison.</seg>

<seg id="604">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has headed the annual apparition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Their representation is descriptive, poignant, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, many of whom wish to believe that it no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>

<seg id="609">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a Greene Co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">He has played the role of Chief-Clanmitglieds for years, but he said the role will never be easier.</seg>

<seg id="614">On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcom, the nests cries and pushes him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "he, vanished from my property!" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="617">The fire disguises the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs loudly.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," said Greene, still chilling.</seg>

<seg id="628">And exactly there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when he says the N word, he says it sharply and with imprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are screams, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman clothed with grief stands above the bodies of the actors and brings Billie Holidays a grieving lobbying called "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred metres behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgian overwhelming moisture every nearly eight hours, when Brooks is leading her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land, where the Lynch Mords took place, the air feels spooky.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the final notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's name.</seg>
<seg id="643">Kids hock at their heads, register the counterfeit blood and the silent body and whisper each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they're not really dead," mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes greens would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the Lynchrope and wipe away their tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit, who played the Clanmember.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.</seg>

<seg id="650">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we know that this is not in your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="651">You did it for a reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="653">At a table a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the position with a black pair that they just met.</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinsky fought to find words that had left the performance.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their interdividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job cuts, which General Director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, in which already 4.000 positions were lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May, Pearson announced a third cost reduction programme to reduce cost reduction by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) in order to revive a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="724">A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, shared a statement by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qaragh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a statement by NATO, it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosives" carried out by people. "</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement is that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaragh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite District of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops pushed Taliban away from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration, repeating that the states are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency because of the crotch.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end the decision was clear: in the case of two votes, the local council of Fluorn-Wintzels decided to establish a common room in the future retirement residence.</seg>
<seg id="749">Prior to the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land is signed, says mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">It will still take some time before the church community has been in the communal ownership so far, but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common space.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living area of around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council enites such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorical living, but openly entering the church.</seg>
<seg id="755">As an example, the word "knckcafé" made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget, will be decided by funding opportunities already last autumn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the refurbishment area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a communal space would be, so reported Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a dome between the legs in this regard, stating that both saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces trump height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer writes, be this additive.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it happens unanimously to the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as simple as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "" "" "Daniela's call points to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well, but now you lean into the common room out of the window, she says:" "" "" "" "I am hard with it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covered subsidy to anyhow wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus, but I get a real exchange value, which is marketable in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">According to StaBG's request to submit the proposal, there are three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">So it remains with two counterparts in the original program that Stefan Haller summarizes: "if we believe the decision, we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="798">This is the purpose of the club observatory Sankt Andreasberg.</seg>
<seg id="799">There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="800">A "star trail" comes to meet the need for information of many Harzgoers, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="801">It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.</seg>

<seg id="804">Inquestion: St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the tables should be complemented by the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">Therefore, a good mobile network welcome plays a role in selecting location.</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the train will be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the Starpath, the viewers experience much worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.</seg>
<seg id="810">They also learned why stars could have different colors or why a star is stronger than another, although it lies far more distant.</seg>
<seg id="811">I will also teach in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">Since 2014 the association runs the highest situated observatory of Northern Germany in the St. Andreasberg mountain town.</seg>
<seg id="813">According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">In the Uni-Stadt, since 2003, there is something similar to the planned star-werg - the planet's path since 2003 - at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen.</seg>
<seg id="816">Starting from Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "off-ground" location in Diemarden (municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.</seg>
<seg id="817">The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">The earth shrinks to a diameter of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the Sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="819">The total distance of the planet is four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="820">While the light from sun to Pluto requires about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto.</seg>

<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Sättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the asylum process, you should make more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, migration sales have sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "might be under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the figures are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581 she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age evaluation, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we can't say it, we shouldn't do it as if we could," "" "" "" "he told the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency maintained the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of being incorrectly judged as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in Plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a heavy concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Road and Transport in Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began simultaneously on all three renovation needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Lightweight is certain that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly modernized.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red colored sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">On Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has received a 30-metre wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge canopy on the north side on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border forging, which is also used as an operational route.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20-metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway was to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger-tip-sensation has the laying of lines required by the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished initially.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pasture towards Schramberg traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully blocked.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge alloys amounts to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>
<seg id="931">AfD in Gerolstein: bunter Protest with German potato salad</seg>
<seg id="932">It doesn't happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under one hat.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the power day of volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a wide alliance that shows peacefully this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell is inviting "large election campaign opening" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-developers but demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful picture that offers itself.</seg>
<seg id="939">And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the forum One World and one of the decisive organizers, is really happy: "great, how many people have come together here."</seg>
<seg id="940">There is music and lots of food, including an "urGerman potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.</seg>
<seg id="941">The police has ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence mainly at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.</seg>
<seg id="942">How did AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes was reported by the AfD vulcanic Eifel, he tried to make such an event and get the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentius Church there were not enough parking places available.</seg>
<seg id="945">"" "" "" "now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that" "" "" "" "we can have such a nice event here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "he says:" "" "" "" "this is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="947">This also does it: around 8pm there is a band for entertainment at the Rondellplatz, in the Stadthalle various speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the auditorium there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now, the police had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour takes the AfD-Event, the guests at the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can move - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="955">Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="1111">The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules that were launched by the UEFA in 2011 means that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 million (262 million dollars) to extract Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich host family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to counter legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to break even a break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini at his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP trial period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to dissuade from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years amounts to 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members of the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might attempt to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their income through companies tied to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarisches company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rate, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 contested that Neymar will become World Cup Ambassador and could easily find such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive, to keep in mind any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar last owner of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new goggia supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline writes the order anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," "" "" "" "said the spokesperson." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1165">Approximately 17 million small red-white packaged panels of 14 grams will distribute the flight attendants to the passengers each year prior to landing.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to give any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider estimates the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But even more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a goggy manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss will not be able to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In question, however, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolate bars distribute Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to joining a contract with Migros daughter Barry Callebaut has supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, the customers of the First Class will be pampered by confectioneries of the fiserie Sprüngli, in business class washing passengers Scoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is also nostalgic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that were spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By dividing to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play dirty children who will grow up - nevertheless, they managed to win the last part of the Witzes back.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the pediment principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90-s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character enchants by an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippenbart of Singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise such as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I consider to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even to "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also a fabricating producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are dubbed in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice days to watch (the police are spending the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick tailman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes, it pulls itself away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was edited for a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregory and Iosef must always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist public is that the Western culture can make everything for food for a subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against Drugs-Mafia in the Country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and were already arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and hundreds of thousands of euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two persons were arrested during the same raids in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians, there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators participated in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 police officers were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia members are accused of organised drug crimes, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating constancy against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the big insert was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In the course of the investigation, Italian citizens with close ties to the Italian Mafia came to the fore.</seg>

<seg id="1230">Shortcomings in the data recorded there could lead to partly serious misdecisions in case of asylum procedures and deportations, in a manner in which the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" is present.</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the registers, there are estimated ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data has not been adequately maintained, the quality of data has not been good in parts so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 was found, "by people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register."</seg>

<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the German government has obviously started sending refugees back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have arrived from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation on a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they signalled that in the coming years, interest increases would be necessary in order to raise the inflation heated by the Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package published a year after Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1270">After deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, GDP will remain weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">At the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "slightly greater" extent than the markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The Bank emphasised however that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank for this and next year adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% forecast projected in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision not to change after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations on a rise in interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by rising inflation and minor salaries, as the tightening first becomes worse before it becomes better.</seg>
<seg id="1281">She added that monetary policy could not "prevent" the collapse of earnings in the coming years, "but she added that wages would be" clear "at the end of their three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which is compensated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote which caused the sinking of the pound.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this has been expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2% is "wholly" to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "given the recent swap rate decline, the mortgage market is likely to become stronger again, as the creditors are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The market looks very good for those with whom the existing deals run out and the new mortgages shut down, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "</seg>

<seg id="1298">Prep to take prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In hospitals, suitable participants are identified which agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will cost £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to evaluate the entire potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as it is used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of lasting progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" "" "" "" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September to, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England in order to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "now that prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "the beginning of the prep process is welcomed and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt will take us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV, and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, was resized in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and an mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to pick us up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the top or bottom." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforcement, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very important, so that if you push the door very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage box, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high quality materials, giving the room its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and that will help create emotional ties in a home," "" "" "" "said Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you do not fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of somewhat standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers struggling for a $500 million real estate agent</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate imperialisms of Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and assets are to be shared.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial record says that Colin property is owned by $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought of the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Colin, as Paul claimed to have ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but rather throws Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affirmdavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin asserting that Mark had paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "" "" "Paul says," "" "" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much, although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really not say much," because the case is before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quarrel," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wants to repair: poor information falling into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnoses makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "" "" "said the former campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February of Politico." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control according to six former electoral campaigns consists in ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumpet's tweets could contain even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him for several times, their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House assembled from competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - wholly occupied with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisors to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and to figure out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone viviously gave a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump is receiving."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof company by the then Ambiente GmbH mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnights per year were lost and revenues by the tourist tax were also lost.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a gathering shelter for the administrative office, which meant controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the building.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house in the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigates Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has taken up the work over the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" referring to people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper marked the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The sender CNN reported that there were already first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there was agreement between Trumpet Electoral Campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps as a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special Investigator Trump in person has moved to the centre and investigate whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to test the present evidence in possible breakthroughs and decide whether it is alleged to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called Trial Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to pre-charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. Trump counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then chief election chief Paul Manafort were in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment would show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "nevertheless, the approval of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason to concern President Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the topic gives the democrats a possibility to" "" "" "" "feeling good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the Sonderager on" fair "way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the president." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed since it was explained in the statement.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has loosened itself from the Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs about one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the ice age is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, in the past 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice-tufts in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Koloss, which is now broken, has so far been part of the Larsen-C Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and breaking off some years ago was disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete horseshoe is crumbling there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some talk about the fact that the Larsen-C Shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can disintegrate if a piece of water is broken down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic, with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," "" "" "" "he also affirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of ice caps in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has grown by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is counting on the areas where the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a house rate at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU calls for withdrawal from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs have penetrated the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administrative office in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously highly coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle is still lacking in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in Mettmann's circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "the management should" "" "" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage, that is to say.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, to demonstrate concrete measures for entry-level entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "speech is from a downright" "" "" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Already in the day of the circle he made a big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cover and startled the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked which allow withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not arrive at a satisfying solution at short notice, the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county-related towns - a house tariff," said nations.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees tariffs for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly mandatory, increases or more money is only available when you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees were concerned with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the sound of NGO migrants "rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs to deploy lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in detailed examples of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew will board the dinghy migrants, who are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the records of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not carry any "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine female bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation at the Wachenheimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for touring.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents, for the long triumphs rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People's Party sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the lookout point at the lookout point, connected by "flowige" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers have inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also approached.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga supports E-Sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting for wind and weather over stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal states involved increasingly in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>

<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA-simulation FIFA will be fought at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, liges have long since established themselves, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certain to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport, because it is competitive and has many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But there are also problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports failed.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the road internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years.</seg>

<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and France, the soccer league clubs according to Dutt are now obliged to set up an E-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to impose another, commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, hop on a building, create yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted to draw attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1695">Good, the stand could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi was also able to interpret the sign from the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight year old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a handler in the C-Elf, who had come from youth, but he was chosen as a handler.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar-l is most preferable to those of whom one has a lot of herbs that one wants to keep in a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who were chosen to join the heritage of Lahm can use a small extra motivation only.</seg>

<seg id="1705">He had the view to the whole while many others were occupied with themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1731">This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is expected to be construction law.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country also plays the western enclosure of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister of Minister Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a guide to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">As from Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) tries to obtain a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that has been sagging for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing is an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euro is foreseen for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">In the planned road construction, facts need to be created quickly, at the same time missing the land at the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Until now, there are only 29 jobs from 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">CDU Group vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the accounting station; the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of regional roads.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In addition, Frank natus expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies had only rated the power supply in an IHK-survey with a rating of 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about staggering internet connections and outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW-president said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options in terms of driving constraints," and was referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - forbidding or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles modified in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, systems for neutralising diesel-driven exhaust gases also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of violating the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested, but can be traced back to normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1767">So that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft travels through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.</seg>
<seg id="1768">If you go to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoon draftsmen, the buttons of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85, the Argentineer still draws and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message:" "" "" "" "laughter," "" "" "" "Because there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first few years as an artist, he hit himself among other things as draftsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, his breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60's: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The artist was always inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV show with his characters.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender in Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small chicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf-cads, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant heads with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered are better water distribution and slowing down the evaporation out of the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines Mexico's growing threat</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodosia usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office that was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodosia, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," writes Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodosio building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely put to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodosia, however, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discussing security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we are strust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosia in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there's practically nothing but silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot down on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums of drug kingdoms, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodosia, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangs purchased each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez after the seizure of another newspaper publishing the same story, leaving the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without pushing for the drug" "" "" "", "Bojorquez said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time the newspaper deserved a reputation because of bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters preferred to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to handle otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodosia, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ-award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task that you as journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and landing ways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodosiya Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in a joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen whom the Governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, odosia has licked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to government spending concentrating on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source of the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers to protest against the murders of journalists, turned around because employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by posting in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces hiding under a ceiling with the organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media fan group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana did in 2004 by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Dario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, admits that the drug trade is frightening him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodosice sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curb edge they have published the news on the site of Riodosia on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howling nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez cast a glance at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Among the mighty portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodosice followed his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her for reporting on the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even notice that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it would have had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the ancestral armored dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosauriers who lived in the middle of the retacing time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has been astonished by researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The file discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paratrooping technique that is known as a counter-shading which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to move better into his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of the borealopelta is far beyond that of the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were chased by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivore behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous dinosaurs predators of the retaceous period must have been," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on pointers on his life, including his preserved Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Floorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "" "" "said Brown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early circling time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just chatting a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The retacing time was a time when huge baths, carnivorous dinosaurs, that stood on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he entered the Suncor Millenium mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's ancestral armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater remation of the dinosaur kept his armour exquisite in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Haufists still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is' rare as winning in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">Its right front foot rests on its side, its five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles have been involved in a mass balbolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometres long stume and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first information of the police there were about 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (the district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm about 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, intersected.</seg>
<seg id="1976">First of all, there are no information on the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of driving in Munich, a back-up of about ten kilometres was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As a AZ Reporter has reported, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle manufacturers, which now have to count on delicate penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transport orter and a car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tested "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is unsuspecting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deepened in his work and just have an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and awakes one unsuspected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A test operation is currently underway on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we expand it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year, "said a rail speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" takes the train ticket devaluation without conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use this, however, some requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to have access to the train, DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, a seat reservation is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2003">For the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">At the test customers a button for electronic evaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating place Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at ticket control at place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants checked in the DB Navigator itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"" "" "" "this allows passengers to make their journey time more personal," "" "" "" "says Michael Peterson, DB Remote Management Board Member." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travellers not all the documents needed to devaluation online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one's own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections between ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Bride sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police killed just a 18 year old child, and it is still on the road," "" "" "" "said it there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retaved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from St. Louis area was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She picked her cell phone to go back to the Canfield Drive in the evening in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the superscription: "Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said," "" "" "" "I am going to kill you... animals all kill." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that's not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened during the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and of protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance that is made up of people's eyes and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter who carried a flower-dress and a fitting crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I couldn't take it with me," "" "" "" "said Ferrell later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what is happening today is a high point of... what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take on for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was President at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Ferrell came to mind a question: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals was the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after blackout shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us. we're talking," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, how these people will be presented, for so I will be presented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The aim was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the movie "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who stirred up this energy," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not a coincidence, although it was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman there is so much at stake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">She still sticks to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-reader discussing bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and enemies since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery said: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work it will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been in the market hall almost every week for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maids are always very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, pay attention to the amount of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "but it should not be very low in the new project." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping centre in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rent there are often non-portable to a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special deals almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "" "" "Wolf Fandel:" "" "" "" "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not suit Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market hall be during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"" "" "" "or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all the shops from Bitburg?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupanders and Haarlem, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic notifications publicly available on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 counts including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-shirt, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg joined the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts, such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became an unequal Brieffler, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili's Kanungo illustrated comic "suppressed images," which foresaw a future in which the President would transform Legseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagersborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandths of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides in the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, all of us are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with you is that our genome will not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spouses Memories, are also to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2158">Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, the acts of the County Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the scene of the event, and Detectives inspect the stitches as murder, while the police actively sought the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubindigo, Vice President of University Relationships, said in an e-mail statement that he had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to submit to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," said Guglielmi. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that both lanthem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will finish the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice-Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-implementation of Rusada and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko he doesn't include anything that could cause Russia to worry.</seg>

<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in public subsidized doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made an error." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2192">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day, Smirnov answered problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one precludes to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Rusada was eliminated in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping scandal of the WADA by conducting doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July WADA General Director Olivier Niggli explained that Rusada was "moving in the right direction" in order to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next buyer</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to check the luck with your e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-up race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographics groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the finance-technical Web site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">It has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS-hotline, which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the court of public opinion has grasped regulators," "" "" "" "said Patrick Lemlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees treat poorly or behave inethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent are offering your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a firm do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you will not follow employees," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about why I should?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate actions the same day if a problem was reported via Glint, so saved.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company will always gain new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11pm when a lot of UCLA-Footballers converse on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before they return next morning at 6: 30 a.m. to the water man Football Center.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the player's burden, and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the fry shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood carried out practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should keep up with 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal play preparations for their kicking off against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2274">Break-ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb impression on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that's his thumb impression!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were also there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greetings a little"), this all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gardeners, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "" "" "then, at night he drank" Whiskey "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps showing who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell depicts his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made until years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be a dreamers, always paying debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men dissolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlady. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his deployment in the castle.</seg>

<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the head of government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This led to the number of civilians in the YAS in the number of survivors.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government pulls the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exil Preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees Erdogan as a wire-driver of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who have been involved in the coup attempt, is being negotiated in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the coup attempt as a "gift of God," given that he had given him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "discomfort in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifest itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban for soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale building in the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 civilian servants by decree, 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan was taming the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered to be the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they called upon their role as sentinels of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan was forced to take the helm of the military step by step, not least with reference to the reform directives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeting the Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an officer named after the attempted coup in fear of persecution in foreign countries warned the Turkish army in a few years "full extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In any case, there is a doubt in the Alliance after the purges of the Turkish army's readiness for action.</seg>
<seg id="2364">The leadership structures and operational skills are "weakened," says Nato diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for Green Card</seg>
<seg id="2366">There will be a new US Immigration Plan to change the Green Card rules, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.</seg>
<seg id="2367">He foresees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, strict rules on obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by giving the US the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.</seg>
<seg id="2372">This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by American media.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Ministry wants route for shuttle shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again and again over the past few months the future of the race belt has been disputed - now it's going to be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the marble stretch on which the tourist train drives.</seg>
<seg id="2376">According to the Ministry of Transport, construction works on the track will begin this year in order to secure the future of the race trailer in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and sane the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country commits itself to this particularly important connection," explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of overhaul the route was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country assumes 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country, is currently being voted definitively, said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," "" "" "" "said Sühl." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">As a result, the race-gate shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The race-gate shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the course of a pilot operation in the past few months, it has been tested whether the circuit is being used by many people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also partly cloudy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more common," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuffs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that a steppe-woman would look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuffs have developed into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed celebrities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "" "" "in mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one takes a step on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, disturb one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "says it on the website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement point to something Dunkless and lowering in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they remain provisionally on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is permeated from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly evolved sex robots come up in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' Der Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the closed body and the raised eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personages," robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background story, nothing hinting independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expressions of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Slumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all going to rigorously strive to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">It is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by a trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the grusky way that one day his kittens won't be repulsed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republican Republicans are "normalized" who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild penal.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park division, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals rotate in order to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-sparkling music communicates this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the themed Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The central park carousel, however, is still a curious magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to review my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year, he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, enjoying them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius asserted that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the claim could be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="2459">As Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberg schools, the quadrant pupils from Fats and Epfenhofen were discharged into the holidays and the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">At Tuesday evening Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol of the release, the 29 students of the four classes voted under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, a young eagle that grew up in the chicken yard, but then released into the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">On top of that, the lower band performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the poultry farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it hatched by his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of chicken weens, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken, and the eagle made his wings wide on a high mountain.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders wore to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stands for the integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young animal is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Its determination is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wanted every four-teller to feel accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">There followed a letter of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who again and again came up with classroom passports, and the parental representatives.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The coast time is over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared.</seg>
<seg id="2477">After two years of teaching, she only unravels her students, because it was a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally she was able to rely on the four-door changers.</seg>
<seg id="2479">Finally, all students left a song of summer time and holiday time.</seg>
<seg id="2480">In doing so, great joy broke out among the children.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Eight first-class vehicles have already registered for the new school year.</seg>
<seg id="2482">Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece</seg>
<seg id="2483">Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camps in Greece, shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.</seg>
<seg id="2484">On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal tents was arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have sharpened control of the free camp and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2488">The controls will continue throughout the season.</seg>
<seg id="2489">The ministry said that the court could impose a fine.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>

<seg id="2506">How long should the retrofitting take place overall?</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but adequate applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a member of the town for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he imparts in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfill the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time to familiarize with the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must point out corresponding agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function intends to keep the city in any event.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends too far towards the inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan is tolerant of tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe which was separated from that which had not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers allowed L reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. cruteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG's urban development were informed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened to date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been sanitation areas in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had acquired two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government Presidency Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, amounting to 500 000 Euros from the country, the rest of the commune of sensations.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be set as statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The period of approval for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would be carried out only once, in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statutes aim to take place as soon as possible, so that the rehabilitation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every Commune had to carry out the proposed preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating the conditions of urban development and deciding when to be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military's data to the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fireman car and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commandeur of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to its supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July in the morning at 15 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the grass was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew should be required for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could harm the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you were locked," answered the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event the president gave a push for the reform of the reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundabarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, however, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "determining the costs for taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon Neymar's persecution after issuing a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record assault?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, whereby Paul Pogba returns to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board is insisting that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report lists Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse falls relieves pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," declared after publication in front of the German Press Agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the director of St. Benedict XVI's 93-year-old brother.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly benefit the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticised that reporting about violence in the domains of the Cathedral was measured with "two measures."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is a "shameful and shameful act," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarafa, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scarponia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "we are happy to go to the church and that's a mess feeding."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "blows were a very normal educational means" to deal with cheeky children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, for the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuses, pope Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "" "" "author and historian Michael Hesemann writes," "" "" "" "Mein Bruder of the Pope" "" "" "" "written by Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the attorney Ulrich Weber who was instructed by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. uses forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims judge the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the Final Report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in the genders" of the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which was palpably palpable when a domain kit had no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one makes the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask oneself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is specifically dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, of which too late or first hints are not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all interviewees as - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent certificate, describes him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who fed the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always moved from children's grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to breakdowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed ear-cowards and too cheeky boys to the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually happens in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not with his publicity and his role as Benedict XVI's brother, that many media threw himself on him straight.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many people who have never understood him are still working zealously.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report lists Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported a lot about the issue of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also subjected to any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," said an officer representing others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who, in a professional sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed it like this: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is reputed to him... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more open than towards their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to relate his good name to these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media there was much of" "" "" "" "violence" "" "" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "" "" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "" "" "Shows" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let us say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrendous test pedagogy, the cases where boys from sadistic teachers were rightfully chedged and maltolerated and suffered, all of them occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "on this, like most witnesses," "" "" "" "primary school" "" "" "" "was taboo." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R." and therefore, in numerous cases, even in spite of violence, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which the states were reported to him at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did George Ratzinger consistently devour ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he pointed out," "" "" "" "that in the preliminary school the punishment would continue to be practiced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as inspectors were also banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael hesemann: we historians are talking about" "" "" "" "the pitfall of anachronism" "" "" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past to today's moral standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abominable at all times, and not for what has been broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent child souls, that goes far beyond that of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger into shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear-cowards and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, it kept strictly against it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger published in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject examiner also available in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Cathedral sparrows played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all admit that he was carrying a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism without the challenge of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, real cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't even get a big singer from stubborn boys and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced wonderful, humorous, deep-faith, deep-faith and heart-hearted people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do something too much for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emerigement, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has brought them the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is extremely unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the start-up would be, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps nobody of Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
