28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found in West@@ field Mall on Wednesday morning , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco , with the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation was underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with the fact that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had captured his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia announced that Frank lived in host@@ els at first , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
joining his family with his family was to always cook something , prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confron@@ tation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond sh@@ outing bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the support phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as Miss Perfect , as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend their time at home , in front of the TV with delicious demo@@ li@@ tion and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children in order to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports py@@ rami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues sought a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden sports py@@ rami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they drove home to the fe@@ ats in the fast g@@ allo@@ p .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again close to horses .
he let himself be led with his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even s@@ wore for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports hall was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small g@@ ala the Golden Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
Lan@@ ger is the 18th winner of the World Py@@ ramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25@@ ,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
the performances include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the f@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stage , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. pres@@ idency vote on tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a basic , rather philosophi@@ cal difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate his death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton , on the other hand , states that the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes on the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the need to invest , tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ can Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , some party @-@ internal discussions could be added to Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate the coal mining industry in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and the Paris climate protection agreement intends to termin@@ ate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and challenge the renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ one trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go down , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand there is tr@@ ump that wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point to him , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled wife has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a big kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Guide .
it has been officially opened recently .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman that arrives here has experiences with sexual violence in her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; she tells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal secretly from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that is what drives them away .
on the escape this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , they are mis@@ leading .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it requires more accommodations only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in the government &apos;s accommodations .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , only fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own homes only for single women and their children in some community establishments .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations for women exclusively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the rush , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new work combat measures
assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new measures of work in their li@@ tigation regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been appointed to ministers to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and to address the official new negotiations with all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures beginning at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in assist@@ ants to strike six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to the refusal of the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 physicians and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be imposed for@@ ci@@ bly .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and pro@@ claim an official end to the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara is the most willing to do this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iles nar@@ ro@@ wed and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loving friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s glo@@ wing , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin sm@@ iled and accused Ankara of having fallen into his back .
the off@@ ence was even greater , because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ne@@ vet@@ ous will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from il@@ lic@@ it oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disp@@ uted this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was granted the excuse of the President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been ab@@ duc@@ ted by a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have sha@@ ken him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ day rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forec@@ asted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it looks at the reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on how to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus for sure in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st once described it to represent the &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have viol@@ ated themselves from the West and badly treated and are now feder@@ ated .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference declared that they had not even touched the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey has deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Executive Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
the Bank has since been dist@@ ancing itself since it nearly collap@@ sed and had to be saved eight years ago .
at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer finance brands .
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange are transferred to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that are getting more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gets its 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori bre@@ ws champagne after a double at New@@ market , which yields 3.@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , practi@@ sed by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which differs from others in the control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie already had nearly 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated milestone with a typical flying dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , 1996 , but he also survived an air@@ plane crash and was banned from drug prohibition .
three years ago he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character strength to de@@ fy his doubts and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin bin@@ ds Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s cra@@ mp@@ ing group of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is said that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s deputy since 2012 , was named after his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief of the protocol and the Head of the Government of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as Head of State regarding legislative dra@@ fts and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are sm@@ iling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - char@@ itable post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people , whom he trusted most .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of minist@@ erial activity had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , appro@@ ving ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to the Opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my entire heart blood in the last 12 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only hope for a series .
the scheduled radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
puzzles for fish landing in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff asked for help in the identification of the fish , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ her@@ ed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; ceiling fan , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ted ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower , which is currently under construction , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team was working , were tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still being alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life station hit B@@ ST alert on Friday at 13 : 20 AM after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and put the worst in front of us , &quot; said the leader of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones b@@ ail@@ out station .
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ oy without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue ship and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has a@@ wo@@ ken over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police reported yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment in order to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic bl@@ ends the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by his hand and body .
the police were able to arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this aler@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ boy@@ friend .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; living room &quot; to the next council session .
but contro@@ vers@@ y is inevitable .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all homes will have to exhibit as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable flats , however , can also arise in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the major issue in the town hall was , however , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of apartments as social housing as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incen@@ tives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to comply with as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er constraints on investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , there is a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market .
if the plan of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the program is not quite complete , because the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will run out over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , so the plan@@ ing @-@ policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , now @-@ running ties from the city should be purchased .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into the price bond .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for the end of the year Fri@@ sten is running in the western city .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back into the price fixing for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one is away from the goal of so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the town .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must take the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have focused on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for video games in the 1990s ( later created a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when it was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped up for the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person returns every day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , announced the Washington Post only recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; met de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people looking mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always there are gr@@ ump@@ y toys , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could have tra@@ ced our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will uni@@ fy the apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the New Testament
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant all along the line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast recovered on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish beam during the individual competition of women in artificial tur@@ nings at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in individual competition between women in the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training flight into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina carried through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish Bar and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - are listening .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor , there was another one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her end @-@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground exercise she cast off the crowd to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s rapidly spreading twe@@ et has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in case of mass murder in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder was not the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , because the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in 9 attacks within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were tied and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .

a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also released a police report on the shooting , which dropped half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like most of his age @-@ mates , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course you &apos;ve got involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund may walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ wl up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and bike rides .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and prognos@@ es can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ iana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi river floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rain , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the communities affected already .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south of Louis@@ iana until Saturday .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch to drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near B@@ aton Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Louis@@ iana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ ward @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow across the beaten rivers in Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , rose greatly over night .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flo@@ wed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a rise in the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the abilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flo@@ ods had swi@@ ft@@ ly spread out , as there were heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer announced in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground through the ra@@ inf@@ alls has been a considerable success since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and flo@@ ods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and a study trip in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a destroyed 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , who were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flo@@ ods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to accommodate evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a nearly two dozen roads were closed because of flood water and sand@@ bags provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flo@@ ods we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his specifications , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but there were no reports on Friday .
Kei@@ th To@@ wn@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said To@@ wn@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the waist , leg , arm , and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was rated cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical state ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were finding out whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the wal@@ k@@ way , there were hul@@ ls .
so it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; reported police agent Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are currently reporting the video surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse ra@@ cket when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ nen and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I am with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew , and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female female female was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this sport , but we do not see gymnas@@ tics classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to join the olymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality looks so that Tur@@ nes is an expensive sport and is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymnas@@ tics societies lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is a costly and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we must au@@ n the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training .
I founded my gym for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my home town ) to provide the youth with high quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des Olympic Team Gold and thanks for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s suggestion
the ministers were hoping to finish the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted for election refused him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the maintenance of time @-@ to @-@ day hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Regist@@ rar denti@@ sts , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; denti@@ sts have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current situation crisis and ab@@ ate it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ving disputes by discussions promp@@ ted the government to participate , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was one of the promises Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done for the last month that his door would always stand open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the attention and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a rise of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and physicians were included in order to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , requested the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures reach nothing of the only little , but already put strain on over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only sorrow , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last two months , we spoke to the Committee of the Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ denti@@ sts and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es to concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wings .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from a professional apprentices@@ hip , training vac@@ ations , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after the authorities have been advised to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Management Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness holds vot@@ ers flour@@ ishing in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today dis@@ closed .
former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore evidence of election mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption politi@@ cian , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off bands outside elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should carry out a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must call his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give their vote to prevent anyone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he claims that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of non official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ ction Ch@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a Special Court ruled that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was supposed to be ab@@ duc@@ ted following a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alle@@ g@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud across the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed himself particularly al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the elder members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding principles to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that state institutions would have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence papers to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has given her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
to conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election .
a three year limitation on applications for automatic correspondence .
prohibition that political activists edit full let@@ ins and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police gave the authority to set up a lock@@ out to establish electoral stations .
a change in the law which facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the 1983 repression of the People &apos;s Par@@ liament@@ ary Act ( 1983 ) .
ban on photography in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fying the training to make sure that the employees have the rule that vot@@ ers go alone to the election booth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric falls over the Metropol@@ itan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ an@@ ei in corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ achment inspec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are thr@@ illed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T aside from the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ winner at the heart of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only Ath@@ lete competing for gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one can give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ ging on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians who show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain Ar@@ dy@@ mus could be the twin of A @-@ celeb@@ r@@ ity Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;m doing it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the center of attention this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large expressive eyes is said to be the double @-@ wear@@ er for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , showing similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a t@@ witter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alists in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
excit@@ edly , he passed as a man , and died as a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ in , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor rods , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ u@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tiques of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came swi@@ ft@@ ly and hard , many of whom talked about him
Twitter users didn &apos;t think back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ec@@ elt .
a short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who presented the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment posted by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times in the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies of Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Rus@@ sel ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments made by Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos;s comments centered on the performance of swi@@ mmer@@ ing and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where they were supposed to see when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a landmark to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered how she looked at it , pulled it out and put them back to the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she began to dance and leave the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took off a pair of under@@ pants , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , because they put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to go back and out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How hard to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you are approached from behind , then you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before h@@ itting it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist , while the Att@@ acker squee@@ zes before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight on your gun at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker on your chest , then rotate the gun from its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sho@@ ots his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went a serious examination of his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ ef@@ il@@ ess by panel some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted his course on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a pur@@ ging button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before landing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and let us know what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results into daylight .
the thought of removing the pur@@ ging button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he ann@@ ul@@ led , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine , traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to dish@@ washing up of toilets , the task assigned its immune system to a test
in the film he said : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud@@ dy water . &quot;
in the film he was doing justice to his reputation .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry value of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to le@@ ak after her lumin@@ ometric number amounted to over 4,000 units , while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 units .
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish producer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in bow@@ el health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in color@@ ect@@ al health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we have included some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
Gen@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before Del@@ og@@ ation Social Housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of dis@@ comfort from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being viol@@ ently removed from their property , sho@@ cked cler@@ ks of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who worked for house management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the interim and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all people , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ lied her and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly this week by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always worse .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally away , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the village .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see has lined up to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall Housing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers in the property administration will now have to clean up gar@@ bage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine @-@ penalty after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation at Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will run ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row of the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the rules of the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ gered after a eff@@ ac@@ ent military jet beach flies
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a port@@ ug@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force put an incredible dive
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists begin to panic after a typ@@ ing jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun@@ bath@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ uno Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane crashed down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flew .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet was somewhat lower than usual due to the poor visibility , but the air forces waited for safety at no time .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people coming to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which limited his view
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is the first step to win the first title triumph in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the return trip increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ Win will have to disp@@ ense with the superior cup@@ in@@ alist and go@@ vern Europa League champion among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar , who will contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , Go@@ alie also l@@ acks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo was clari@@ fied .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but for that T@@ er St@@ egen has the privilege of the majority of the applicants .
before the first duty play of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness of the team at the Spanish master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner of this competition .

mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with themselves .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this point I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump is dre@@ aming of &quot; huge problems ″ in the campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ ened his election campaign short@@ com@@ ings in the former rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp from the race , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilty of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media contacts .
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds sha@@ king
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equal to the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview by the sender CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how to re @-@ stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I &apos;ve done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that is right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to submit funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present better survey values .
instead of this , the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; candidates for the Congress would be stronger than the arms .
Olympia : triple fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro Olympic Games .
following a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced immediately to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine specimen in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association submitted the IO@@ C to investigate the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has distributed and signed up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Kenya Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was at Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan European Athletics Leader , Michael Rot@@ ich , was dra@@ fted by the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments athletes of his country .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
for a long time , Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing passes .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls laid out by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on African land before the summer games in Brazil , creating an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics begins .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports from the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport has been op@@ t@@ op@@ ed nation@@ wide and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games afterwards .
the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria , as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pac@@ es and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminis@@ ces with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enor@@ mously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for him , conducting is a necessity .
you see it in every movement , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same subjects and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls leaving London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London went to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain the Supreme Court in case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Senate Democrats , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell , believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the de@@ ceased Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court in Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he would not have been talking to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of App@@ eals for the District of Columbia .
RAID said rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants nu@@ dity calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Belle@@ mere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine was distingu@@ ish@@ able from Old@@ school play@@ boys , since Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he &apos;s the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to depic@@ tion timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adapt and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , it could even &quot; become a few hundred thousand , &quot; says the President of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany because of the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand asylum seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ taken months of Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are on the run within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ ty put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks come to the fore .
many will want to start new in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of the Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or exp@@ elled already over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President urged the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria positioned against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic is held . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially the Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t adapt and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures issued by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set up the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and thus almost 29 per cent of all eligible candidates ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no av@@ ail of war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid as far : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - this bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
the most beautiful vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and put out voices at the end , only troubles@@ ome .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign nearly to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , now lies clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition ground .
cel@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one can see from his posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ d@@ red predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , sea ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which would probably cost him the best office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its peak candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time , it is in the right place election campaign .
Angela Merkel has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel Bundestag election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR .
but it is also a pity not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U elimin@@ ates the usual ev@@ ap@@ oration levels on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , co@@ king , plays only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union , too , has noticed that in the country you need to gr@@ ind the ground , that it must be very strict to find a way to the people again .
you are here like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the suburbs of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign co@@ king on his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign .
in pol@@ ls , the social demo@@ crats were at least 22 per cent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election in 2011 , the SPD had gained a clear victory at 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of holiday des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion and place their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , Green Ele@@ ction campaig@@ ners go on search for local vot@@ ers among vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , curi@@ ously cur@@ v@@ ates with a hou@@ s@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ burg@@ ischen lakes and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ urb@@ ishment : Gast@@ stätten suffer under lock
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only ends at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all kinds of praise .
&quot; they have made everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the app@@ liance of those responsible for the construction work will also be commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of housing drives .
since the construction site immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation in the village has been relaxed .
the citizens can now sail from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the unavoi@@ dable traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was partly considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says Florian King , deputy head office manager responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of the Sch@@ leich@@ weg searched and more familiar to their nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks are fran@@ king in residential areas .
since speed limits were not observed , the municipality exac@@ erb@@ ated the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable sur@@ mis@@ es , &quot; says King , who made himself informed himself on the spot .
there have been two to three per minute flas@@ hing .
the fastest speed was 77 hours per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the street is now open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to a drop in sales of them leaves everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
even with the aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; at most slight decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the career is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the local streets along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ enti@@ ally threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is offset by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his co @-@ workers .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant could profit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where it was handled so much more gener@@ ously .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now looking for less frequently due to the complicated traffic management .
if you cannot approach it , it &apos;s also somewhere else nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele has returned to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal .
laws are constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of counter @-@ terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère proposes a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status with terror to do ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the con@@ cili@@ ator .
all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs at the presentation of his new security package .
they do not challenge anybody .
other further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was at results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Mr. de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has brought a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes on a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD until now : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck off the German passport with double nationality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conc@@ edes the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this for reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans quick procedures for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ aining people from dep@@ ortation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones first and make social media accounts open for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
many things also seem un@@ break@@ able and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this really have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be denied that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in the face of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly concern the human being let themselves be excluded even in election campaign periods .
the inner security is enor@@ mously ind@@ ented .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , there was a great deal between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a long dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy @-@ collection of some of the Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the kni@@ gh@@ chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka prohibition and a revers@@ al from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
we have concluded the discussion in Germany .
re@@ alizing it is not sensible .
and he has constitutional objec@@ tions to a Bur@@ ka ban .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent in all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still be revealed .
there is a lot of things to fight for .
but the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel communic@@ ates carefully and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen still got off lightly .
despite the diesel engines , delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action there is confusion around a term .
Volkswagen starts delivery in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can still show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , the brand &apos;s core brand fell weak@@ ly in Western Europe and thereby imp@@ acted the overall sales as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold more than 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the previous year &apos;s figure of 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries were sack@@ ed by almost one sixth .
brand distributor Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a purchase restra@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , too , the British vote for leaving the EU broke down , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus for beech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected family brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen is getting off lightly by the diesel s@@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a drop of 0.9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July , Group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to demonstrate sales growth .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million carri@@ ages to retro@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative impact .
after upgra@@ ding the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after retro@@ fitting a &quot; guarantee @-@ loan &quot; certificate , the car manufacturer places a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in company circles .
the reason is legal fin@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the German Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and of KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take any deteri@@ or@@ ations after retro@@ fitting and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , half a year after the conversion , for example , customers could come back to a garage with a engine failure - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in customer interest too , it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas sc@@ andal can lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savings - as second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who par@@ ked 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks talks about an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings would not be afraid of paying pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee demands Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been be@@ ware of 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot invest for each million 4000 euros . &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs continue to exist .
to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank &apos;s stand .
most customers had understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association of the association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with penalty interest for deposits worth € 3 million , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - und Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , principal managing director of the banking association said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nation@@ wide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is endo@@ wed with wealth a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she keeps money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known who calculate a compensation for private customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not like that in their width .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you go to the comment section to sow it under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ gro men &apos;s middle ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of records is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to be tra@@ ced back to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their emotions more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with You@@ go@@ v &apos;s results ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wil@@ dly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s slowly l@@ acks its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand close to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , presum@@ ably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I presum@@ ably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who buy records tend to be intro@@ ver@@ ted rather than spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , which he meets , apply to You@@ go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media dog , people who heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I &apos;ve managed , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to realize that record businesses have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took off@@ ence in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record hul@@ ls , from objects that call for happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s with me as a collector so and I think it &apos;s like that with lots of people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ aps out of a stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I bla@@ sted through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( quantity of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less musi@@ cl@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
g@@ allo@@ p , which has devoted the vinyl records to almost a whole floor , has an entertaining audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz reson@@ ates from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it makes a window @-@ shopping rather than a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression of dar@@ ing je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young te@@ ens group@@ ing around Polar@@ oid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors living in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning with the b@@ um@@ bling through panels of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator , who stands up over the shoulders of an investig@@ ative middle @-@ aged man .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the Cal@@ ais authorities , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and which could pose a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also reported that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who had the 72 temporary businesses , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed only people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated non@@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survi@@ vors in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .
despite the Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fierce

&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup looking forward , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Jan@@ eiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; I hon@@ estly find it hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; said Martin .
he argu@@ ed that he had to analyze the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group climb@@ s up for live video games start @-@ up
watching other people watching video games is a huge game - Microsoft wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys start @-@ up Be@@ am speci@@ alizing in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the take @-@ over .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also pick up yourself .
for example , they can give up players missions and counter@@ pose enemies and provide equipment .
the Play@@ er@@ ese Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
on the way to global media event , Facebook is supposed to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up , previously in Seattle in the U.S. federal state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , such as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and chief Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customers .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market for video games is growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
t@@ witch was bought by online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to rely on the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are to particularly effectively transfer temples .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits and pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays to time , strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to sound , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also bus@@ h@@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 items last year .
Britain fet@@ ches Silver in 7 @-@ year @-@ old Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins Gold
the impressive performance of Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ year rug@@ by hit the finale on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ epp@@ ing , back @-@ up , line running and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt away by the not too bad beat rate of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but in this form , Fi@@ ji would have beaten up a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ vel at the attacks of G@@ Bs .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co. as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was hat@@ ching in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
an ug@@ ly T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an void ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for the UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Se@@ als , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame made the icing on the cake in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced himself and the UK ki@@ cked out crus@@ hing in the tur@@ f .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the British 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no remote gold as with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first ru@@ dder angle to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter the story Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if only the two were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when she ro@@ wed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who put such a benchmark .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ mate un@@ defeated insert , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lete who gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no one aid as the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I have done , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started closing , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t interested in making something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race whatever we did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the tv @-@ adventure Steve Bak@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for the past 31 years
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk some time ago in the original sound .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken praised the association .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe is &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who joined the company for 31 years , is 28 years as managing director .
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe drinking water association with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ ality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congreg@@ ations are Kirch@@ hart , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was employed as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ er@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance to office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , refurb@@ ishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and you have always added innovations , because water means life is dec@@ ute and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct ministry over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for the past 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful butter@@ fly .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and restructuring of the ken@@ nel association .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe break at the high container near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
you can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility company was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she should die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now learn in private in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that &apos;s back for two years when I sang to La Scala , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass @-@ bar@@ it@@ one Erwin Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock and mort@@ ally injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his companion of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him I shall be publicly prosec@@ uted .
now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald .
meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun , so the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially didn &apos;t want to give any information about the perpet@@ r@@ ator or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but she confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that are threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the renewable energy reverse at existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to use the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental statement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production .
as a result , the status qu@@ o of the current regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weigh@@ ed in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European Manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual plants .
in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel compared to the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the set amount went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been down two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp had already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good to her health and mind .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors are doing a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they are in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations , shared singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies themselves , people who have fallen ill themselves suffer from long rec@@ umbent occur@@ ren@@ ces .
in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concent@@ rating on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone are prac@@ tising so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practice for a long time , I become better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ bly than tom@@ cats on the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the call of k@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ auen also didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved like the females in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens that are in great need , as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary college and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers are also respon@@ ding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous survey the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a call of little ones , which were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited babies who were up@@ lifted .
despite the small sample , the researchers consider their results to be meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned out faster to the loud@@ speakers , when the ho@@ oves of the very excited cats played off .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have been resear@@ ching the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in the past .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the put@@ sch attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted suicide attempt in July .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
football doesn &apos;t stop even before football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Public Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South East living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has virtually no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Be@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club traditionally do not belong to the friends of the President .
but in the face of dramatic experience in history , however , in the face of dramatic experience , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 goals and 9 templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory finale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the rounds kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also spa@@ wn early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ me@@ g Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of play was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season tickets as Sü@@ me@@ g @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher king .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
after the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , standing under contract at AC Florence , had announced that it would not return after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if the storm should be willing to give up approximately one @-@ third of its annual salt intake of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for the purpose of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa is not allowed to start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other exagger@@ ated athle@@ tics sinners can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line of the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who compl@@ ained about her start right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing ban , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fla@@ wed and rested at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ ry scene : with a raised smile , she was still proud of the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the crowd broke out in a j@@ ump @-@ storm .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9,80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to reti@@ re for a six @-@ month period in 2010 after the use of the Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don pain relief .
after an operation she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ hospit@@ able intake and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and was locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , headed by Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ stein , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been recognized as many medals afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his world championship title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release the 2004 Olympics due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse .
he also returned to the Bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a judgment of the International Criminal Court ( CAS ) .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) fell mild and expi@@ red on 13 July .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
they planned their home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning there were again two explo@@ sives , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive was in the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast police .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast had several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express oneself to possible motives - but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited regions and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact time and places .
it is still un@@ clear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instruc@@ ted their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always minor bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ written bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to comply with the instructions given by the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) charges the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were cancelled a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution prepared by the jun@@ ta .
this also gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power after a period of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces in 2014 , is self @-@ assured to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok during a attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has fallen into the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several sover@@ eig@@ ns , the constitutional shel@@ ters in the Federal Government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; in the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; we see evidence for as@@ pi@@ rations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Protection Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aßen of the German press agency in Berlin .
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional shel@@ ters in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ties . &quot;
Ma@@ aßen said , his authority was closely aligned with the sover@@ eig@@ ns during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak to you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an em@@ ble@@ matic advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t have any findings .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the substantial increase in justi@@ fi@@ ably committed crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Gruppe .
there may be other right @-@ wing group@@ ings or small groups that plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee marri@@ ages or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned expressed themselves that many ass@@ aults on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
that is the concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or world records are not always determining the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his trial with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59@@ th place of 59 .
but it was not his straight athle@@ tic figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
since most sport@@ s@@ men walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel the W@@ al . &quot;
following a &quot; prosperity boom &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time , he just hit the 100 meter fre@@ estyle with a minute and almost five seconds , didn &apos;t matter .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a lead over 100 meters of free style .
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old then learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Square has been stolen .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday , and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she came back to 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock the next morning , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash register .
traces of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the imp@@ ending electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already made an alternative video .
he then goes to vacation .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , he wouldn &apos;t mind it . &quot; ultimately , it will work either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that &apos;s right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance formed itself .
post lifts into trade with electric transp@@ urs
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is apparently great .
the Post plans to sell its electric car Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group plans to start trading with the transp@@ orter shortly .
the Post Office will also offer its electric transp@@ orter on the free car market next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been checking whether they want to sell their self @-@ designed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other companies .
post @-@ Management Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ des had said that there will always be demand , such as tra@@ des@@ men .
following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to start mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and provide a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K leadership aband@@ ons dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the retreat suddenly came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resig@@ nation of the corporate management , the global number Five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
as early as the 1st of September , the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger took over the management board , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to officially take over the role of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
those who will lead the market research company in the future are still un@@ clear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles it was said on Friday , with the shareholders the dis@@ appointment about the further lasting successes of the restructuring initiated several years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes un@@ stable at some point .
&quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also be the Qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; said it .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales contra@@ cted by 3.4 percent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were primarily affected by the un@@ dr@@ illed value of the company .
the company value depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience Business Unit generated a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros to the Group .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in cro@@ um@@ m@@ ns in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( the district of Aur@@ ich ) in the event of an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck , which was partly on the counter run@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue vehicles and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back by a bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to contact the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wast@@ ewater are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of wast@@ ewater treatment plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ hai 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ ewater fee will increase at the latest if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that underground coverings run under cover for these wast@@ ewater plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering manner .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed to the committee , a calculation of the fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and over covers from the previous calculation period are also to be compens@@ ated .
for all three wast@@ ewater facilities , Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ewater attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the small distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the past calculation period , rehabilitation and repair expenses were incurred in a significant extent , not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair costs .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Az@@ endorf .
in the pump@@ ing plant Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond treatment plant L@@ opp had to be postpon@@ ed after almost 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system has to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses came the ongoing care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small waste water waste in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully carried out . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs had been spar@@ ed in the wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years .
the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the long term , especially since the supply area of the sewage @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal is not possible to expand these facilities , because it is a matter of deficit .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July on a monthly basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % have been posted .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ appearances come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have raised criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and in@@ convenient . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a highly contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not fla@@ w@@ less , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the dim @-@ out extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in breed than their older antagon@@ ists - might expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently hired a HR officer who focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes congress committee
military members of the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot , a report on Thursday announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Com@@ mitt@@ ees Committee , Intelligence Committee and Military Service Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence anal@@ ysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically in@@ gen@@ ious by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the real conditions on the spot and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are enough to reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail consistent issues in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given orders to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts face pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than it respon@@ ds to facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com Associ@@ ate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress Member of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 up to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command tips changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after it was assigned that anal@@ ysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed information while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; issued the highest ranking Democ@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compens@@ ated the morality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. ship and demo@@ crats gave no evidence of the White House intervention in Cent@@ Com &apos;s anal@@ ysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was received by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alle@@ g@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the information about the Islamic State ev@@ okes quar@@ rels about more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush pre@@ viewed only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government authorities , stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial position as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember having ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a little longer in the strong Dutch , which will lead to the other group .
as always the game comes out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 , she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work package in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder ri@@ pping around completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into play without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book one goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the trampoline of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and as@@ piration .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ guard to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tournament .
the Olympic flame does not highlight every event .
further away from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may have long rule .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it has been so spar@@ sely noticed the last 16 years that many of those I had ques@@ tioned didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 has had an ath@@ lete who has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
trampoline jumping has a certain external aspect , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a clo@@ wn school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending whi@@ m@@ hole - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially un@@ ites .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and need a number of slo@@ ping movements ( turning , h@@ encing , and sal@@ tos ) before landing on their feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ ad programme , they are assessed according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but in the television transmission also another highlight : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful pur@@ suit is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even beat a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is up .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back upwards .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the contest can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of women will be staged on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final laps as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympic Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ us and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community .
&quot; one generation is prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just about to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response has been un@@ mer@@ ciful .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , presum@@ ably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the government &apos;s suppression - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the vast pastures of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiopia .
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the governing coalition .
following a widely @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de after years of the previous H@@ ink@@ an@@ kles under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and business while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos regions .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and domin@@ ating the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly sha@@ ved in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands prot@@ ested against elections which , according to anal@@ ysts , had apparently been dec@@ eived by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , led shops of Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray gets more and more common in social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West is un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally supporting democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin seed migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not meant seriously .
this clari@@ fication prov@@ oked new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take refuge in protecting him during an event@@ ful period , in the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements that he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ ined back on the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama will destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism jumps down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries of politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his testim@@ onies vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed a more corro@@ sive tone since his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while increasingly focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump has made Scher@@ ze his loyal co @-@ workers in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , were struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it rear @-@ bear@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of guiding and taking action against him on any of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats s@@ coff@@ ed at Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
once driven by the price of the market , Café comes back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a stu@@ ffed cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displac@@ ed .
the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , purchased by Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
domestic mour@@ ners betra@@ yed it as the last loss in a den@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but when New York is change , it is also new finding .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ tions like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was about coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long and loyal customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap shop took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee bar bre@@ wed by the coffee bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground than the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees seemed like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies from Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tor@@ to@@ ise Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a rep@@ orter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh @-@ cheese sandwich with olive @-@ pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
as the rep@@ orter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple for a discussion on food in the era of great depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food products were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ oks for male field@@ work and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary diet was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
unique mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious gra@@ tification had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - under@@ took the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women &quot; and the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delic@@ acies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like president Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ fold man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wearing a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ itment of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt contributed to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , has been disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country got back on its legs .
the legacy rests on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the Battle of the Wind .
after the plate was evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e emphasized a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest name .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a little rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E was repeated three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bom@@ bing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to the image paper , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die of saving lives , I think that God sees me as a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had talked about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; we are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died .
the Assad regime &apos;s deadly bomb had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks only get offspring with 150 years .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai swim lei@@ surely along the North Atlantic Ocean , an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour .
only when it arrives , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full length of 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle , characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a dru@@ id for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist believed that Greenland ha@@ ie would become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the icy sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les &apos; lifestyle .
they measured their slow motion when they put six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard with a transmitter .
nevertheless , these shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which are bent down@@ wards from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ y , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 502 centimet@@ ers measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
hence their birth was supposed to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons cache forced large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ y had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old even with 502 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females get offspring only when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign age to an age .
since one of the animals was at the threshold of the sexually mature with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication become obviously at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no accident that such methane hydr@@ ates live mainly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland @-@ wh@@ ale , in whose bacon on the neck is a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fl@@ aming flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council focused on topics relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying have been clari@@ fied , the sale of the land in the residential areas &quot; Street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ oks appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au .
as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lige will be able to report to the Town Hall immediately , and the community council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to en@@ force requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in sub @-@ sections .
in the Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n area , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two parallel plots in the direction of the state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
as a result , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether there will be any further financial transactions carried out by London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to be approved in the UK .
they just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the German lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg has a large f@@ ond@@ ant industry , it cuts off its infrastructure as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city with an easy @-@ to @-@ find commercial property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands in seventh place , Luxemburg on number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W conclu@@ des .
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the econom@@ ists think .
in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs of hepatitis C Patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Jud@@ ge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc may claim the reimbur@@ sement of legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C contro@@ vers@@ y with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the inf@@ rin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after an American judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ cks , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US representative Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled at the expense incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alize with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claim each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , which include So@@ fos@@ co@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have taken full control of the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned them , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ating the city after the still remaining group of fighters who have du@@ g up within the city .
they freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ host@@ ages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish to the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters who were alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats and their husband , and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated USD 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ ors ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n Hel@@ pers Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false exc@@ uses and rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance in regards to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign hero Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter in terms of the publication of the Democratic Pres@@ idency of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Advisor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before tax inspec@@ tions are not complete .
critics , among others , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already reli@@ ed that his refusal to ask questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business relations and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , asking the Republi@@ can Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans to publish his tax return .
on Thursday they spoke about the topic even during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that in the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday who stated that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the IR@@ S and tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , a@@ ver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 clin@@ tons tax return showed that this only referred to USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works promote Tanzania Ele@@ phant protection
natural prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , has strengthened its funding together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World &apos;s Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; says the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chi@@ li@@ powder in the air .
a breath is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a fire@@ work in the air and creates a loud , bright explosion .
town council unanim@@ ously decides : no Ki@@ os@@ kne@@ ub@@ au am St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of tra@@ des@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and assume - especially the retail trade in the core capital is regarded as clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
however , the City Council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski park on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we generally welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed position on the shores of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director crushed Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media boom after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli codes , as Arabic guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust Docum@@ entation Sho@@ ah , made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
the country was , however , not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol also offers a chance to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is eradi@@ cated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cler@@ k of Lanz@@ mann quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered quite a lot of resonance on the internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski hotel that it would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed , &quot; it was stated in another article stating that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all alle@@ g@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , the Spiegel reported .
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung said a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police relies on tear gas &amp; rubber fin against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian City of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms to the public education system .
the police put in tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which caused the police to introduce rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the demonstr@@ ators saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti &apos;s protest against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on the walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in masses went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismis@@ sed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , and the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies adopt existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading activity was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation gave some 3@@ 5,000 visits , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
search for witnesses : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had surrounded their faces , demanded the issu@@ ing of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled to foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been captured .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot located opposite the parking lot with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently notify the police .

four stages were tac@@ kl@@ ed together .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in the next two years , the Upper minist@@ rant round St. Anna has decided to prepare and execute a several day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and they finally decided to visit the B@@ ish@@ ops &quot; City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was offered at the Freiburg Min@@ ster .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Brit@@ on wins gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor roll that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to conc@@ eal a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after taking place in March at the World Championships in London , despite the resig@@ nation of Ho@@ ys , only modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y prev@@ ailed - and Sk@@ inner translated into the qualification laps of a olymp@@ ic record , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prev@@ ailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he was scar@@ ce back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation leading to a higher gear in order to slow it down and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up a world record in the final round and defeated the world champ@@ ions .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he was inten@@ tionally desc@@ ending on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement , and there was no claim of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we had so badly come away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect a successful five days in the vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will be competing in the spr@@ int , which will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22 : 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argu@@ ed yesterday with officials before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition that will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train wheel team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a range of medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , with the resig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ tu@@ als and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land melting due to the aboli@@ tion of energy demand
the future of aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply agreements , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land stand at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - might be at risk at closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa acquired the Point Henry melting plant , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in its annual retreat in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a dism@@ iss@@ al .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to negotiate the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting industry , or to ensure the power to melt the melt &quot; did not affect .
the U.S. company said that it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
anal@@ ysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the anal@@ ysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consum@@ es about 900 MW of electricity per year and approximately 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this is the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot almost every birthday p@@ ago@@ da of a child &apos;s broadcast ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; you thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue for Vo@@ gue is the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an image volume as a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still si@@ ck@@ ened prior to the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ age model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ mi@@ cks of the moment . &quot;
these feelings matched up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to jump around on the mis@@ sm@@ iles seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings by Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in Reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
annual centers of law reject 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief figures are annually rejected by the community centres , while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further a@@ verages on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - in their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s church centres said that the last survey of the National Council of Community Cultural Centr@@ es resulted in thousands of people being rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without raising the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are under@@ financed by chronic , which means thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and overwhelming debt , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wron@@ g@@ ly dismis@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the German government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Prosec@@ utor and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employee report@@ edly moved weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ activity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on an employee in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had waited for months to wait for the matter to be settled internally before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to align damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bord@@ ini announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint .
Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be responsible for violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological harm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
he was not respon@@ sive to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far held a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries election : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18th September ) considerable losses for the government parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U are notable .
this revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue making the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just close to the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
in spite of slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the German Social Democ@@ rat SPD ( SPD ) showed only 23 percent of the survey ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 per cent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were thus still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , but the pir@@ ates would miss out on the other hand in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet tal@@ ker .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west @-@ pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible by brow@@ sing HTML browsers , al@@ beit slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proudly the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Fin@@ n &apos;s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today the market is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming to this end .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : one music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success , even today , is the iPhone &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today , every German is viewing his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , responsible for staff in the Siemens management board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country , not only in our local communities and throughout London .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new teachers , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding ha@@ ar@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will flash on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single infrastructure projects .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on current growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from T5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies earning money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; is the same .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ f@@ re struggle between the upcoming open source community and the hang@@ ers has already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ pi@@ ons have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ cker ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has the exception of ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues out so that Facebook seems to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be its &quot; ad preference tool &quot; to allow people more control of advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control in people &apos;s hands .
woman passing presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was driving on a motorway in the early hours of the morning with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark in an act of despair &quot; and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police who prompt this as well as any witnesses of the incident promp@@ ted me to report .
an investigation procedure opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a col@@ lision avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman of the neg@@ ligent murder was acqu@@ itted after having crossed and killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the street , the court accepted .
the Court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
according to the projections of a new NA@@ SA climate model Venus was probably inhabit@@ able .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have er@@ d@@ similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect against quicker ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus makes its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
although it was suppos@@ edly hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned off by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen with@@ drew , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative @-@ President / General Manager of the col@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
I have been thinking over the summer long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ sler take talks again , sit down strike
the labour struggles on re@@ mun@@ eration for North sea oil workers are suspended , while all the con@@ parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
the Wood Group &apos;s oil field service provider has been spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep a few full day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start next year to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its counter@@ sectors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent as a result of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s down@@ fall follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismis@@ sed thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped to collect the complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary origin .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now swi@@ ft@@ ly turning .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars cast large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when an aster@@ isk climb@@ s , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , whereby bigger stars revol@@ ve more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still a lot ahead of us about what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak up their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star performs
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ star all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed several mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two additional bas@@ eb@@ all players assign similar values in the most important statistics .
but in the hall of the bas@@ eb@@ all , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted .
for as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to its involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , it was closed to 211 parts by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting agents for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends get the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and met the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e &apos;s arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the trailer at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ can and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
catch : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a j@@ unk ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Rio de Jan@@ eiro Olympic Games .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ va from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil positively and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically ac@@ claimed athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the accident .
Ch@@ en has demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday which is used as a m@@ astic remedy for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Court of Justice ( CAS ) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Freestyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association assumes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; X@@ in@@ hua quoted from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court ( CAS ) and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanc@@ tioning of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ eko@@ can , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive itself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the bi@@ dden matter should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ eko@@ can has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already have a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes are not taking the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight li@@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z .
both of them deny intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes &quot; start , Dan@@ eko@@ vi@@ wa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , as well as the production of bad news in Rio in Rio .
in addition , in swimming sports , the former off@@ ences in China were also taken care of between athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de but only had to sit down a three month lock .
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mailing malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the solvent required by the perpet@@ rators to be able to re@@ use the attacked systems and data .
according to the sight@@ ings of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators are increasingly speci@@ alising in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially er@@ pres@@ sive ran@@ som will be considerably higher than those of private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks was made fri@@ ghtening over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software subsequently presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
in order to get the final encryption code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currency .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies need sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even to completely inter@@ rupt their business activities , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ heads and came to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they talk to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free .
and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the malware kits have been created by installing malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; usually the criminals hire sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten with the publication of sensitive data such as client lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the damage potential much higher depending on the type of data .
the perpet@@ rators will also be able to set up entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the h@@ acker conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heating system could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
there is not only a boot of 45@@ 3 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema seats and offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the boot is well loaded , but the loading height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the top variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the col@@ lision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the col@@ lision @-@ war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent cruise control respon@@ ds to the sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped , top @-@ level diesel engines are all right .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court ( Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed that liability is conceivable only in the event of danger that is typical of aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
illness : when the organiz@@ er pays
those who get sick leave money after their trip only if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the treated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Turks holiday .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , which suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip would have been fla@@ wed with it - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
although the wast@@ ewater treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not hurt his information obligations , so the judgment .
since no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the disorder of several hotel guests - possibly caused by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general life @-@ risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be sensible and resol@@ utely at the same time react to terrorist threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and spl@@ itting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this will increase the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to implement proposals for the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit orders over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
video surveillance should be improved , the law of arms has to be revised in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed tail light for doctors is supposed to be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens , &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka prohibition and the aboli@@ tion of dual nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is considered un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t ban everything that you refuse , and I oppose wearing bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate the act of action and ability to act with the new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et Fle@@ et and a ti@@ ghtening of the right of residence bring people to this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway fe@@ eder
it looks regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal remedies should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic at the traffic road every night when they cross the auto@@ bahn ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße the right @-@ off road by 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split in the early days , thus improving the overall production process on the busy traffic section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Apostle district of Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ stri@@ ction on the fe@@ eder is anno@@ ying the drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is limited only one lane by motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over a good three @-@ quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to record heavy duty traffic two @-@ lane .
the responsible regional company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related traffic jam will continue .
however , years have to be expected : the bridge has an official remaining service life by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal remedies , the country consciously chose the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected .
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Woo@@ den School Children &apos;s House has visited an award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theatre of Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Association , 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , the press release of the young@@ ster Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December you@@ ths with and without a refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language transmission are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope to improve weather
the weather has made the star s@@ nu@@ ff Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a grain through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ des , which belong to the fastest star @-@ buck@@ les with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evenings , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up @-@ ring no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Batt@@ les and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understand@@ ably understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus a sleeping and sleeping disorder .
just falling asleep find many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board of directors of the German GP Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and may start to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , as well as an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces become a doctor ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and will be imp@@ aired in the day , you should go to the doctor , say good@@ bye .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is down@@ cast , tired , exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
this is why you should first contact your family doctor in case of sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ ining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
in order to study in the sleep laboratory , medical doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory drop@@ pers , in case of illness fatigue , sleeping conver@@ ters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after snor@@ k@@ eling , one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gle , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera at the ceiling character@@ ises the sleeping ends .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws , where you can put for a better sleep .
it also counts : regular sleeping and standing times , do not sleep too long , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he first brought gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ ground world championships and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler , via Facebook , has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team mates standing in criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € and a jungle car is worth € 15@@ 0,000 , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming is bad , on the other hand , dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be en@@ rolled nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who now runs an ice cream shop .
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the police officers of the police in Düsseldorf managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and luggage ste@@ els as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to polic@@ emen from past th@@ ef@@ ts .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acies from mid @-@ July of this year and have been working in a collaborative , working and professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves which had been submitted specially for the suspension of criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they had captured a total of over 15@@ ,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lime @-@ trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not appear at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
in recent weeks , article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Henkel has voted several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after evacu@@ ating the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ ast@@ mi@@ ths with 300 police officers on 22 June , the police pat@@ rolled off official statements three weeks ago with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on the ground , blocked off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street works peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walks in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of late sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the building projects they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kiev who mostly wanted police protection against the sc@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police force between the squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood which , even today , has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
in the former G@@ DR , many houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße quite close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Mainz was evacu@@ ated under a large police charge in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and suff@@ oc@@ ators from all over the world : with them , residents from G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ ants now share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them at disc@@ ar@@ ded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were disc@@ ar@@ ded with colour bags .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are caused by material damage , which tends to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the disp@@ uted 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately pulled into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the residents with@@ drew their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly demanded interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former gaps that displac@@ ed the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are indeed con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well searched here , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin von Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled those who are f@@ ond of colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood of Kie@@ z .
those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain about noise there .
all persons with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organiz@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the aff@@ lu@@ ent wo@@ olen ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
for instance , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
a management professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , has just been an aff@@ lu@@ ent wo@@ olen mil@@ let .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon to be found in Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the provision of connection .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to municipality and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
the administration does not find private apartments de fac@@ to .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be made , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
prospect is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are internship plac@@ ements , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ Euro job and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be gre@@ ased or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and language courses .
professional courses are rare .
here , too , administration and hon@@ orary official jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases exist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the latest happ@@ enings be afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde quite clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks brought them completely into retri@@ bution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and hon@@ orary officials have to look for activities on the spot and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new b@@ ump of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
the policy is afraid of answering this question clearly .
in fact , it is un@@ fair to place them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter wanted
