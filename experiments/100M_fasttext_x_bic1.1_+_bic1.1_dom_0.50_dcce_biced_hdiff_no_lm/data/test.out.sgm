<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramide</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they drove home to the feats in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swore for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports hall was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th winner of the World Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means very much to me," Langer says, "" "" "" "" because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been supporting the offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports."</seg>
<seg id="24">The performances include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-rider Meinhard Nehmer, der Rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstage, where the Lavazza price was running.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept the distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP's trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidency vote on tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a basic, rather philosophical difference." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively go back to regulations, and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states that the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes on the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, trump and Clinton say almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republican Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, some party-internal discussions could be added to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate the coal mining industry in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris climate protection agreement intends to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and challenge the renewable energy with its investment programme:" "" "" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazione trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go down, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand there is trump that wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a big kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Guide.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman that arrives here has experiences with sexual violence in her escape," "" "" "" "said Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "" "" "there are other reasons for the escape in women:" "" "" "" "many steal secretly from seeing no other way out." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murders, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for example, tugs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," "" "" "" "said Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany, they are misleading.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the Munich north are traumatised, they appreciate.</seg>

<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, it requires more accommodations only for them, asks Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction, some answers with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the government's accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, only fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or own homes only for single women and their children in some community establishments.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new measures of work in their litigation regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have been appointed to ministers to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persistently calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "In view of this, the JDC board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and to address the official new negotiations with all your concerns." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to the refusal of the agreed contract terms, which had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes, I can't resist the impression that Ankara is the most willing to do this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiles narrowed and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "" "" "loving friend" "" "" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's glowing, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin smiled and accused Ankara of having fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the nevetous will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illicit oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was granted the excuse of the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been abducted by a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-day rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecasted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti described it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as it looks at the reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing resentment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on how to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus for sure in Ankara that after the attempted coup d'etat, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst once described it to represent the "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that have violated themselves from the West and badly treated and are now federated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference declared that they had not even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the President of Turkey has deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Executive Board of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has since been distancing itself since it nearly collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time, brand strategists "RBS" have used to protect other end consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus more on more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange are transferred to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for private clients that are getting more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">During a sightseeing tour of customers and employees, McEwan was interviewed in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue his Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in his sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands because how do we focus on the inside (we asked ourselves) to make this a better bank for customers?" "" "" "" "said the CEO." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of Putin's cramping group of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin it is said that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Ivanovs's deputy since 2012, was named after his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he later became the chief of the protocol and the Head of the Government of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as Head of State regarding legislative drafts and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin's and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at one time wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - charitable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people, whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of ministerial activity had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approving ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four sealings of the "ceiling fan," which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 slanted ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensferry crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower, which is currently under construction, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "living room" to the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all homes will have to exhibit as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to comply with as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to impose tougher constraints on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the plan of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not quite complete, because the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, so the planing-policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now-running ties from the city should be purchased.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into the price bond.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one is away from the goal of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the town.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time staring on screens has been sued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon which are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found "photographed" (via a screen shot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when it was younger, joined the boat and jumped up for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post only recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to "take 30 minutes time" "" from the sofa, "and" being active every day "met deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are grumpy toys, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could have traced our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unify the apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all along the line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast recovered on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team-mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women of Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish beam during the individual competition of women in artificial turnings at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in individual competition between women in the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and trained by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a training flight into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition, a winning series that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina carried through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish Bar and Bodentures - in which Biles holds the world champion title - are listening.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor, there was another one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her end-bnis - a pure formality - and tears poured on biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Grandma," by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she cast off the crowd to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the 19-year-old's rapidly spreading tweet has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix for a decade, while they stopped in the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the triple murder was not the result of robbery, because the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900, who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in 9 attacks within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard der KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, announced at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were tied and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which dropped half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer's work.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday. it is expected all Saturday with more rainfalls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi river flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rain, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the communities affected already.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high water vehicles, boats and sandbags multiplied.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand bags.</seg>

<seg id="8">The weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch to drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downward-downward flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow across the beaten rivers in Lake Maurepas.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the abilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the floods had swiftly spread out, as there were heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer announced in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground through the rainfalls has been a considerable success since Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police reported that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the waist, leg, arm, and belly, but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he has done a lot, his small body was pierced by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez shared with the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">I can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was rated critically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical state; the other two victims are in stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, shot up, reports the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and the police were finding out whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators divided CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a crossfire between several guns.</seg>
<seg id="16">Patronenhülsen for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, oversewed the crime scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this is clearly a constant struggle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were hulls.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active involved, "reported police agent Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was no arrest, and the police are currently reporting the video surveillance video.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in Turnen and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I am with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female female female was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks so that Turnes is an expensive sport and is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics societies lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is a costly and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must aun the municipalities aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth with high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnasium and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des Olympic Team Gold and thanks for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Resident doctors want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's suggestion</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers were hoping to finish the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted for election refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the treaty forcibly and said that the NHS was found in a "No Man's Land" and that any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the maintenance of time-to-day hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Registrar dentists, announced last night in a communication with: "dentists have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current situation crisis and abate it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolving disputes by discussions prompted the government to participate, and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was one of the promises Jeremy Hunt had done for the last month that his door would always stand open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the attention and address the concerns of the assistance doctors." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a rise of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and physicians were included in order to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better week compensation for the 54.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employee, requested the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>

<seg id="16">Over the last two months, we spoke to the Committee of the Assistenzindentists and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who were returning from a professional apprenticeship, training vacations, mutual recognition of the curriculum, the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug after the authorities have been advised to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the covering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Management Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. the draft bill does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period of time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness holds voters flourishing in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election misuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Communal Government, which is now an anti-corruption politician, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off bands outside elective cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he recommends that voters should carry out a passport to prove their identity in elections." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger if they give their vote to prevent anyone choosing twice.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not only for electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture," "" "" "", "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election Chandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a Special Court ruled that the reigning mayor Luton Rahman was supposed to be abducted following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>

<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarmingly to the fraudulent correspondence - with the elder members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding principles to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistanese or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="22">Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit correspondence papers to stop "reaping."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has given her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">To conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three year limitation on applications for automatic correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit full letins and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police gave the authority to set up a lockout to establish electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in the law which facilitated an accusation of intimidation according to the 1983 repression of the People's Parliamentary Act (1983).</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "intensifying the training to make sure that the employees have the rule that voters go alone to the election booth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the electoral court has declared" "" "" "" "Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litanei in corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approached from behind, then you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist, while the Attacker squeezes before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight on your gun at the same time and beat the Attacker on your chest, then rotate the gun from its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and strangenefiless by panel some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted his course on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a purging button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before landing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and let us know what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results into daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of removing the purging button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he annulled, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine, traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to dishwashing up of toilets, the task assigned its immune system to a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and muddy water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was doing justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample showed a luminometry value of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after her luminometric number amounted to over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in bowel health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad we have included some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of discomfort from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being violently removed from their property, shocked clerks of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who worked for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the interim and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball people, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing dellied her and her partner forcibly this week by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the village.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the lessee has lined up to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided.</seg>

<seg id="13">The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility of the area, the jet was somewhat lower than usual due to the poor visibility, but the air forces waited for safety at no time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, with four people coming to death on Madeira Island.</seg>

<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls laid out by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on African land before the summer games in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics begins.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>

<seg id="25">It has been proven that this sport has been optoped nationwide and systematically.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria, as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their paces and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminisces with melancholy to her love with Tony, while younger Maria is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly, because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very much, my Italian character, whom I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer:" "" "" "" "Cecilia is a wonderful artist." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">For him, conducting is a necessity.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in every movement, in his looks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a happy approach to life, that's very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley's "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "this piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same subjects and they are just as meaningful as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid as far: summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - this bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most beautiful vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and put out voices at the end, only troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign nearly to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, now lies clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly neuling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition ground.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one can see from his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary wordred predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the social democrats were at least 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At election in 2011, the SPD had gained a clear victory at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renurbishment: Gaststätten suffer under lock</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and only ends at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are all kinds of praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The appliance of those responsible for the construction work will also be commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of housing drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site immigrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation in the village has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now sail from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The unavoidable traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partly considerable discomfort," says Florian King, deputy head office manager responsible for the transport-related management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of the Schleichweg searched and more familiar to their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks are franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since speed limits were not observed, the municipality exacerbated the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable surmises," says King, who made himself informed himself on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute flashing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 hours per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to a drop in sales of them leaves everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even with the autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "at most slight decline," but also admits that of course "the career is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the local streets along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existentially threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not just him, but all the restaurants" "" "" "" "hit hard" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the sales revenue is offset by" "" "" "" "far more than 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the road marking has thrown back its operation" "" "" "" "two years ago." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant could profit from the advantages of the location at the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties, where it was handled so much more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now looking for less frequently due to the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot approach it, it's also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele has returned to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner thinks the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected family brand of the Niedersachsen is getting off lightly by the diesel sscandal: after the first seven months, only a drop of 0.9 percent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">From January to July, Group sales leader Fred Kappler continued to demonstrate sales growth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen has manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million carriages to retrofit the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW confirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">After upgrading the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting a "guarantee-loan" certificate, the car manufacturer places a "guarantee" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in company circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal fineness.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Last Monday, this would have confirmed VW representatives in the German Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and of KBA." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from these are not accepted," "" "" "" "said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take any deteriorations after retrofitting and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee," Volkswagen is able to see that for example, half a year after the conversion, for example, customers could come back to a garage with a engine failure - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In customer interest too, it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal can lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym of non-Allegro men's middle ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the reemergence of records is not on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to be traced back to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their emotions more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with Yougov's results?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos slowly lacks its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand close to different men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men middle-aged, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I presumably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted rather than spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, which he meets, apply to Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media dog, people who heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I've managed, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record businesses have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took offence in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record hulls, from objects that call for happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector so and I think it's like that with lots of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "an employee flaps out of a stack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I blasted through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (quantity of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "" "" "I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf" "" "" "", "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less musiclastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people saying," "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Gallop, which has devoted the vinyl records to almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sexbepackter pop instead of experimental jazz resonates from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window-shopping rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression of daring jeans-hotpants, I watch a group of young teens grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of Yougov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors living in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning with the bumbling through panels of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false Moderator, who stands up over the shoulders of an investigative middle-aged man.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the Calais authorities, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid and which could pose a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also reported that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had the 72 temporary businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed only people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain's 7-year rugby hit the finale on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-up, line running and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept away by the not too bad beat rate of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form, Fiji would have beaten up a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to marvel at the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was hatching in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An ugly Tackle of Mitchell halted the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, athlete jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the revival and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through other weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian void... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua toured Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for the UK, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Seals, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the icing on the cake in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang, the Fijis embraced himself and the UK kicked out crushing in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa into a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the British 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exemplary for the past 31 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the Veitensteingruppe, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "Bavaria-wide exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the name of the Bayerischer Rundfunk some time ago in the original sound.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken praised the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitensteingruppe is "Bavaria-wide as exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who joined the company for 31 years, is 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitensteingruppe drinking water association with its headquarters in Kottendorf, Municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The congregations are Kirchhart, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the City of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunns Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was employed as a Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckerverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance to office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the rebuilding of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill and you have always added innovations, because water means life is decute and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct ministry over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart-blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe to the nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for the past 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful butterfly.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well construction and restructuring of the kennel association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe break at the high container near Kirchlouder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">We had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">You can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility company was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that are threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the renewable energy reverse at existing plants for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">According to this, the European Commission had initially planned to use the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a fundamental statement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a significant price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify as the world's largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European Manufacturers reproach Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel compared to the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the set amount went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been down two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp had already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a special form of togetherness." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors are doing a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, shared singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies themselves, people who have fallen ill themselves suffer from long recumbent occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrating on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone are practising so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practice for a long time, I become better and awoke beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the call of katzenbabys has on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the Miauen also didn't let the males get cold - however, they always behaved like the females in contrast to the females.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but I have already left it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">They planned their homeward journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning there were again two explosives, and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the Detonation near the popular beach resort of Patong, which was popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive was in the air in front of the precinct of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast had several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same signature," "" "" "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express oneself to possible motives - but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited regions and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always minor bombings, but mostly they do not turn against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace which was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-written bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to comply with the instructions given by the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) charges the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary trips to these provinces will be discouraged." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were cancelled a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution prepared by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves toward stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power after a period of bloody disturbances in 2014, is self-assured to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost one year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during a attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or world records are not always determining the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte subsequently became viral internethit.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his trial with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59th place of 59.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was not his straight athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen walk in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "Robel the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">Following a "prosperity boom" the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he just hit the 100 meter freestyle with a minute and almost five seconds, didn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">The run of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a lead over 100 meters of free style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from October 1, 2016 for the area of wastewater treatment plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welhai 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (previously 2.26 euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf the wastewater fee will increase at the latest if necessary improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach, it was found that underground coverings run under cover for these wastewater plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As head of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt showed to the committee, a calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and over covers from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For all three wastewater facilities, Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the small distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past calculation period, rehabilitation and repair expenses were incurred in a significant extent, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping plant Welschahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and at the pond treatment plant Lopp had to be postponed after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge has to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system has to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Schmidt:" "" "" "" "for these extraordinary expenses came the ongoing care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small waste water waste in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully carried out. "</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs had been spared in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the sewage-purpose association Friesenbachtal is not possible to expand these facilities, because it is a matter of deficit.</seg>

<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to be a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and inconvenient."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a highly contradictory Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not flawless, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the dim-out extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in breed than their older antagonists - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters an image that is offensive for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their staff, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company has recently hired a HR officer who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, in turn, said she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, establishes congress committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot, a report on Thursday announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committees Committee, Intelligence Committee and Military Service Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically ingenious by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the real conditions on the spot and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "" "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom are enough to reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail consistent issues in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government spikes under Obama have given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than it responds to facts." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom Associate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Member of Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 up to the middle of 2015, the Central Command tips changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after it was assigned that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," issued the highest ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process, Mr Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "compensated the morality among analysts and" gave excessively little room for different opinions. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. ship and democrats gave no evidence of the White House intervention in CentCom's analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was received by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the general inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the information about the Islamic State evokes quarrels about more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush previewed only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position as these temporary refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britches on the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer in the strong Dutch, which will lead to the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game comes out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the trampoline of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the wristguard to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not highlight every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further away from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may have long rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely noticed the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned didn't know that it is a Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal on trampolines and until 2012 has had an athlete who has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trampoline jumping has a certain external aspect, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending whimhole - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and need a number of sloping movements (turning, hencing, and saltos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiad programme, they are assessed according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but in the television transmission also another highlight: that of the world or the Olympiarecords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even beat a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the contest can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will be staged on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final laps as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Angus and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley anticipates his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation is protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response has been unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the government's suppression - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vast pastures of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can use the turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of the previous Hinkankles under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and business while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos regions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and dominating the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly shaved in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands protested against elections which, according to analysts, had apparently been deceived by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of disturbances went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, led shops of Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray gets more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is unequivocally supporting democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this," said Mr Abdi, "" "" "" "" is a very thin seed migration. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had founded ISIS be "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not meant seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification provoked new questions about the communication skills of the Republican Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants who endeavour to take refuge in protecting him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruined back on the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama will destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism jumps down to Mr. Trump while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries of politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his testimonies vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed a more corrosive tone since his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while increasingly focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has made Scherze his loyal co-workers in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent intercessors, were struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "Mr Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of guiding and taking action against him on any of his words.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a stuffed cafe in Williamsburg, in which you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, purchased by Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Domestic mourners betrayed it as the last loss in a denrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel apart and verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But when New York is change, it is also new finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing member of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same bulbs from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnitions like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I realized that it was about coffee and culture in the club that I liked," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal is still getting his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment about the fact that the soap shop took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the coffee bar brewed by the coffee bar.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we'll go down to her offer," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he preferred to exhibit them soon, so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground than the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffees seemed like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies from Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Tortoise Soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, local snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh-cheese sandwich with olive-pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">As the reporter ordered minced meat, this found the couple for a discussion on food in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "rich food products were very popular," "" "" "" "said Ziegelman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooks for male fieldwork and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," "" "" "", "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budgetary diet was equally tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became a staple food, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique mixtures were tried out, as a calorie and nutritious gratification had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that period, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann goes on: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - undertook the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary women" and the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "" "" "is a feast of historic delicacies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, like president Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the millionfold man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wearing a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to take an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruitment of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt contributed to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, has been discarded as soon as the country got back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy rests on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she had a real fear of food waste," "" "" "" "said Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "Ziegelman recalled:" "" "" "" "they really made people ill." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the Battle of the Wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plate was evacuated at Eisenberg's, they and Coe emphasized a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, the president Roosevelt ate at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone showed a little reluctantly a spoon in the teeth, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it was not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönlandhai swim leisurely along the North Atlantic Ocean, an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full length of 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterised by loneliness, seems to be a druid for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionist biologist believed that Greenland haie would become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the icy sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles' lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they put six animals in front of Svalbard with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, these sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, which are bent downwards from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hay, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hence their birth was supposed to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons cache forced large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hay had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Grönland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old even with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females get offspring only when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign age to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals was at the threshold of the sexually mature with 392 centimetres and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication become obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no accident that such methane hydrates live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211-year old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon on the neck is a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flaming flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday, this resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband, and an effective tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated USD 3 million in Redehonors; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for vice-presidency, Senator Tim KAINE from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton published his tax declarations for the past ten years.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim KAINE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," said Clintons Campaign Helpers Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clintons election campaign hero Ian Sams on Twitter in terms of the publication of the Democratic Presidency of the Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before tax inspections are not complete.</seg>

<seg id="2">Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilipuder.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, who already had the idea for years ago, has strengthened its funding together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.</seg>

<seg id="5">Friday is World's Day dedicated to animal welfare.</seg>
<seg id="6">"since we have developed the... Toolkit, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephant," says the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a message.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day walk from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in the next two years, the Upper ministrant round St. Anna has decided to prepare and execute a several day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and they finally decided to visit the Bishops "City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's goal was offered at the Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Rev. Storust sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and shared the pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we went by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster was also a Dear Woman, and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each morning and evening each day was accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field-crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely made Rast to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim-song.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. he made the legend proud when he stormed home to conceal a victory of the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking place in March at the World Championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys, only modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrer Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw the potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner translated into the qualification laps of a olympic record, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he was scarce back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation leading to a higher gear in order to slow it down and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a world record in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally descending on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement, and there was no claim of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "it feels with all the UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We had so badly come away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect a successful five days in the velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will be competing in the sprint, which will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "If he wins two more gold medals he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22: 42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officials before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition that will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a range of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, with the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sextuals and Mobbingvores as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply agreements, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland stand at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - might be at risk at closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominoeffects as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa acquired the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," said the current supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the Treaties in its annual retreat in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of a dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to negotiate the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting industry, or to ensure the power to melt the melt" did not affect.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian Reality-TV-Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians), crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the stereotyped plot almost every birthday pagoda of a child's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence "you thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim may have beaten her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue for Vogue is the most sold issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an image volume as a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the bearing 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still sickened prior to the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities, the model" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-Winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakage model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistmicks of the moment."</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's relief figures are annually rejected by the community centres, while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further averages on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland there are already three of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unjust delogations and similar - in their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the community, which are already overly utilized, are ready for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland James Farrell's church centres said that the last survey of the National Council of Community Cultural Centres resulted in thousands of people being rejected every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without raising the government's decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community centers are underfinanced by chronic, which means thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relations, people with unmanageable and overwhelming debt, families who have been dismissed by separations, workers who have been wrongly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The German government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (18th September) considerable losses for the government parties of the SPD and the CDU are notable.</seg>
<seg id="3">This revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could barely govern in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue making the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just close to the CDU, which could rise to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country's parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of slight losses of 6 per cent (previously 8.7 per cent), the Green Party returned to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the German Social Democrat SPD (SPD) showed only 23 percent of the survey (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They were thus still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (before 11.7 percent).</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "e-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, Nokia communicator came to the market." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clunky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, that would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet talker.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the west-pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by browsing HTML browsers, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proudly the price was: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finn's mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, that is today for a lot of people's everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphones worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming to this end.</seg>

<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones at the Mac-World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: one music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, everything via touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphant success, even today, is the iPhone's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" is the same.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-fre struggle between the upcoming open source community and the hangers has already been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into battle is a strong indication of how worrying scorpions have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was driving on a motorway in the early hours of the morning with a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have erdsimilar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect against quicker evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus makes its day-side of the sun almost two months long," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned off by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen withdrew, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped to collect the complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods are associated with planetary origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now swiftly turning.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these mature stars cast large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When an asterisk climbs, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares stars with dancers, whereby bigger stars revolve more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot ahead of us about what we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak up their "dancing shoes" so to speak.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: so perfide compress hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the anti-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the solvent required by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the sightings of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specialising in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially erpressive ransom will be considerably higher than those of private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was made frightening over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software subsequently presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies need sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Correspondingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had even to completely interrupt their business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always tell the victims:" "" "" "" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackheads and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They talk to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus supplier Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been created by installing malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals hire spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes-Survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion, the offenders threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as client lists or price escalations," explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential much higher depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to set up entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating system could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a boot of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with inverted backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema seats and offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is well loaded, but the loading height is 650 mm a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">All four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision-warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="21">The beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent cruise control responds to the sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack lie below the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped, top-level diesel engines are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline engine will receive from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evenings, one rolls around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the wake-up-ring no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Battles and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understandably understands, however, is the insomnia, thus a sleeping and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just falling asleep find many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German GP Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disturbance expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in depression," "" "" "" "says Weeß." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and may start to pondering about everyday problems and worries, as well as an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and will be impaired in the day, you should go to the doctor, say goodbye.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is downcast, tired, exhausted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact your family doctor in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to study in the sleep laboratory, medical doctors, for example, in snoring with respiratory droppers, in case of illness fatigue, sleeping converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After snorkeling, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body one carries a nasal goggle, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera at the ceiling characterises the sleeping ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws, where you can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It also counts: regular sleeping and standing times, do not sleep too long, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler commented on Facebook for the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first brought gold at the Doha short-ground world championships and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler, via Facebook, has now protected himself from his ex-team mates standing in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €and a jungle car is worth €150,000, nobody should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote at night to Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming is bad, on the other hand, doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">With this we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely or even operate on the subject of doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I'm not saying that controls should be set here," "" "" "" "he continued." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">To start a comeback, Deibler had to be enrolled nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be maintained with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WADA / FINA must not participate," says the election-hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of lime-trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not appear at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent weeks, article about this "trendy neighborhood," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, on the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has voted several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After evacuating the premises on the ground floor, the cadastmiths with 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrolled off official statements three weeks ago with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on the ground, blocked off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street works peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalks in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of late späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiev who mostly wanted police protection against the scandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police force between the squatters and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood which, even today, has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the former GDR, many houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them nearly the entire Mainzer Straße quite close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz was evacuated under a large police charge in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and suffocators from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former home occupants now share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them at discarded slices or freshly painted facades that were discarded with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are caused by material damage, which tends to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately pulled into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents withdrew their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly demanded interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former gaps that displaced the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are indeed condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well searched here," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin von Neugebauer has little understanding for trailed those who are fond of colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood of Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuterle is now there, the affluent woolen chsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For instance, some - less mocking than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">A management professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, has just been an affluent woolen millet.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent stake for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the provision of connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">The administration does not find private apartments de facto.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so you rely on private apartments, so Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be made, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Prospect is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internship placements, training centres, school grounds, one-Euro job and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be greased or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuterle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Here, too, administration and honorary official jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "problem cases exist," "" "" "" "says customer honestly," "" "" "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "" "" "the work of Deuterle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the latest happenings be afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks brought them completely into retribution.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new bump of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is afraid of answering this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
