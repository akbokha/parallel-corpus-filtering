Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ eh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu with a lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal adver@@ tised by Obama about the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which was partially classified as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with reference to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend is shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to point out that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officers found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sten@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb has made the fatal emergency at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated us .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members comprise 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university imply that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education .
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lived in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September , after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica as@@ pi@@ el finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes are res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he killed Schmidt , and that Lamb recorded Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products retail@@ er says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were employed at Christmas time in 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will begin with interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship , and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for roy@@ als , and I realized that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it makes sense to me that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wning and a length of length of it to be with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia is strengthening military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and engage in inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate momentum .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps stamina and start letting their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my popularity values turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa found last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans considers Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish vot@@ ers believe in rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first country of the nation , the state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse into the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they set up their scholars , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers consider tr@@ ump to be real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time that four out of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination vis @-@ à @-@ vis 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is apparent that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers look at tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to dr@@ umps leadership while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made up their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of vot@@ ers who support tr@@ ump say they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that you can never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open in order to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say that they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration of turning and fishing at the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ orientation effort .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday 6 out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump apparently does .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , notably by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the New Moun@@ ting Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; indig@@ nant . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ o@@ ken@@ weg - overlooking the North Sea a@@ watt .
in the street , a square meter of a building site costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers one square meter is most expensive .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top @-@ living standards , however , one of the prizes is similar to pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
double goal sc@@ orer in Pira@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a confident start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze created a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; at the Munich Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pira@@ eus .
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es Treffer ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in the series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third round .
Müller was rewarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without spar@@ ing .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven Europe @-@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but in their aggressive endeav@@ ors , however , they were often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by bac@@ kl@@ ash on the left side of Douglas Costa , which seldom came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k arrived from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion missed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct pick @-@ up which Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had come up with their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set a needle @-@ stick .
but at the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was deser@@ ted .
so for example , when he direc@@ ts a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New Orleans , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain race with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tze , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero gave the green light after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ fore Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the s@@ wollen Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , Müller still put one on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their blo@@ c blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went on strike against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this places a Potsdam long @-@ term study close .
good news : at ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
hair loss main causes are dental c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ si@@ zing the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent fl@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; are writing .
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment fell back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ stau@@ gate Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to a good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has affected the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across the Rhine river bank on remains of late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne the museum is always consul@@ ted as an expert for arch@@ eological heritage preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists were now found to be successful .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery filled with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight train captured
after a young woman died in an accident at the train station in the Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for help .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its way of operation corresponds significantly to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the competent EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish intends to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
T@@ TIP is meant to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings mean con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
it is fores@@ een for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against verdi@@ cts .
until now , the parties agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , a claim against their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström welcomed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own data .
there could then , for instance , clarify disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , the companies can dispute compensation for tax pay@@ ers , break national laws or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act proclaimed the proposals of the European Commission to be inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans to be a major step forward .
the Commission considered significant points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the economics of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the negotiations on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally , there should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
fine folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
just eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart pointing to which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative mis@@ re .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; seem wise composed songs , which harmon@@ ically very close to American folk in the late 1960s but can drift in great opul@@ ence at all times .
rum@@ or is that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the states should be ob@@ s@@ essed .
but already 2004 and in the Rhin@@ eland , already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nation@@ wide ac@@ claimed masterpiece appeared in 2005 .
over@@ l@@ apping ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not in any yearly list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic pieces .
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
since the smaller clubs rose , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle made of neo @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring with Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark held Ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; available since March .
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens sw@@ aller will return to intim@@ acy and folk .
without jud@@ ging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one h@@ ears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only an enc@@ ore makes St@@ ev@@ ens humble , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually tends under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; s
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Q &amp; D and invest for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions just after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had been &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; - according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements to the position on the European Union and the limitation of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised a different approach to policy , says that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the strike with hooks and instead has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Econom@@ ist , will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a guide in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ Theater , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the interviews with the Prime Minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and its position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound ster@@ ly rose according to data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and succ@@ es@@ ful estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v entered .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he earned $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mond@@ i &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment of the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the boss of JD Sports says higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .

at the moment , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 revol@@ ves around .
how to Vik@@ t@@ oria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not too bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ t@@ oria from Poland .
however , since 7 a.m. the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber construction : here you res@@ ide I@@ dol , whose posters hang in st@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer res@@ ides , costs the day exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vik@@ t@@ oria should sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot;
school duty ?
who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also , Bie@@ ber itself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the Advertising pause of the Super@@ sport , he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ pe@@ e firm flus@@ hed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also assi@@ sts .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one st@@ unt at the window @-@ window .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber finally is in the United States and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest her many zer@@ os .
at least it does .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanon to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the word &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y boiled potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida rally with the wording &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , which he had seen by chance on television .
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer that has been sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile admitted the idea to the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
this is why Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes are eaten .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Con@@ stance Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that more details of its def@@ ensive strategy will be released on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take over five percent of the food market in both countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost a $ 13 million profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern States , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business grow by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s , however , and inv@@ ests over $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores through fast growing fresh foods and provide better choices of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s General Manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading @-@ up programs will be committed to Elan , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and ear@@ ns more praise than criticism for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the youngest of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called the &quot; Special K , &quot; was ra@@ mp@@ ed by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ er , with Har@@ rison calling out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f em@@ ailed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the te@@ ens are currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged down a little into the quar@@ rel , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Cy@@ gios at the important preliminary ruling which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has done very quickly what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , with@@ draws refugees
Hungary ev@@ oked the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illegal in the country . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants responded in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and responded to Serbian function@@ aries with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ats over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian pro@@ clam@@ ation police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that &quot; it is un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary will be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people seeking refuge in the over@@ rum@@ ored Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss the European Union &apos;s special summit to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a verb@@ al action from Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency stood on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie d &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for condemned traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government states emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which will be expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security consultant for Or@@ ban said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committ@@ ing crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian civil servants closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos gave the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the primar@@ ies ( 58 per cent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he nomin@@ ates for the Pres@@ idential Board , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the primar@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinions determine which candidate they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders gains some win@@ nings .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders are only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
however , Clinton has yet another advantage in the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons Current supporters are particularly enth@@ r@@ alled by her .
the views are more powerful than those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the primar@@ ies say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval for dealing with the problems and the fe@@ asi@@ bility are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the primar@@ ies would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers of elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if bi@@ den decide not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
bending is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage , which sees it as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ st , &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ers .
similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections will be un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some of the important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the elections of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as an external minister during the term , most of the Democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion for this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion even though 36 percent said that her opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed as honest and trust@@ worthy by the elec@@ tors of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent consider them to be honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of vot@@ ers are also seeing tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes on leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of the 351 @-@ Democratic elec@@ tors in the primar@@ ies is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son shifts close to Donald Tr@@ ump at the nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
the two Candi@@ dates now account for half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic foot@@ ing
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers support nation@@ wide tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support will grow from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump among rep@@ ubli@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen most deeply , and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee , and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the pol@@ ls - with 19 % support among the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also revealed tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign in Io@@ wa .
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , sharing the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other hand , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a student vacation in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the National President of the Brotherhood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the f@@ rat@@ ernity of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the f@@ rat@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student has been dying every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment because of the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of serious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the hou@@ se is falling into fuel , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy again , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a more recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate increases .
more precisely , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , CEO at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and return on return .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up the recession .
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases have been nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants enjoyed the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only has a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all enhancements of 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very soon after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this date has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market has anticipated a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , returns appear to change direction as soon as the first raise / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond pockets are immediately dropped , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause returns to be closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve has increased , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the market features if the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debt will get worse , since an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ vers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also c@@ ited to BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , maintains a leading MP and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also c@@ ited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General dismis@@ sed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that &apos;s truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find new music and order new works on behalf of Radio 3 , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that it was necessary to work harder to engage the public than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to kick off the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory Member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special way .
he added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; when the next time it star@@ es a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money in the fees pay@@ er for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales were slo@@ west in August and Black Friday could be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the record commen@@ ced in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slo@@ wed down editions in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we may experience that growth is decreasing .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , held on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 issues were issued a little over £ 1 online .
for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now conducted via Web @-@ Shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury them that were killed as a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
gri@@ eving filled , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last trip to the former @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession went over to the holy place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds .
the bodies were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king left a san@@ ction on the construction company of the B@@ in Laden &apos;s building because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 beds that were killed as a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca were borne by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the B@@ in Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not tell this detail , but said that the management of the company is forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man vo@@ wed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the big mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the B@@ in Laden Group did not publish any statements about the breakdown of the crane , and their representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also cul@@ min@@ ated the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project run by the B@@ in Laden Group .
B@@ in Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over bigger construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a stolen son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ its increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen in Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at arti@@ sans , are opened
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City CEO of Daily Mail
it is alleged that British have their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of employing a qualified East European handi@@ craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices has now sur@@ passed .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops to address tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate with the employees .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we have to shift this towards equilibrium more strongly .
in principle , half of our women consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also brief@@ ed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company with 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and finance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ f@@ isher showed a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group weigh@@ ed the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and forgiveness .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , had cryst@@ all@@ ised that the def@@ end@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argu@@ ed that the association did not develop an asset at any point in time .
the sports officials had calculated only expense reimbur@@ sement and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread profession of large audi@@ tors of the financial mid@@ day .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we took money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , no debts may be made .
furthermore , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for compens@@ ations has been made retro@@ actively by 1991 , with the corresponding financial result .
therefore one has paid off part of the expense reimbur@@ sement until years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
therefore , packages and not detail@@ ing entries appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and the austerity books jointly managed the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
the judges asked why the pay@@ outs were not dis@@ closed in detail .
the association did not care in detail for the financial situation , it was important to have the freedom of debt , the answer .
in 2011 , against the official abuse of official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot;
why compensation ? , we wanted to know the prosec@@ utor and the prosec@@ utor .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the official said that he never obtained a c@@ ents salary , he calcul@@ ates only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
they were no longer kept in place after a audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage money .
all the dwell@@ ings had to be made in cash , and he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence for the international market , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interview of witnesses .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police employed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water @-@ thro@@ wer .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he told us by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the police there was a water @-@ thro@@ wer .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first stopped using pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now cau@@ ti@@ ously with@@ drawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sm@@ sack@@ ed in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of the decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US emergency database comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last at the current state of 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Emplo@@ ye@@ es at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. C@@ ET on Thursday
letter of death at Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that &quot; he was not going to jail . &quot;
when polic@@ eman caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate title from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , like his lifel@@ i@@ ke on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa group aims to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
the Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgra@@ ding the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the target of the real@@ ignment was an annual contribution of some € 500 million from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more board member for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings budget airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Executive Board , headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the re@@ positioning , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employee strong company has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line group , which represents three @-@ quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict conflict with the pilot @-@ association cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the strike that was stopped by the court on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the wings are the wings concept of Wings .
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is moving forward to the Group &apos;s own Euro@@ wings tril@@ lion line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ zug in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the Künstler@@ haus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United not able to play for months because of double Fra@@ ktur
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to crying and closing it out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had burst into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then performs fantas@@ tically , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until June next .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ abel of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead plays a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added new characters and details to bro@@ aden the fairly short original text .
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agre@@ es to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy h@@ ears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ading , thri@@ ving On@@ ce @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ ir@@ t , pu@@ bic creature that speaks in the name of the trees .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons collabor@@ ators , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to find Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air Cook &apos;s page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t be sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali evol@@ ves as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from England &apos;s test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that ti@@ ck@@ players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to set its mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and off .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a hit man , whom I highly recommend .
he is a X factor Cri@@ cket@@ eers , what we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the representation of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mos@@ ques alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred coun@@ sels straight away and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ ins that raise their hands and the trainers op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart additions to the training program .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dee , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights that we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot has received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = United Kingdom &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ u if the economy falls into a fl@@ aut until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented re @-@ negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , just as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract amend@@ ments , which they mostly do not wish to be full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes a Great Britain inside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; Berlin says - and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essi@@ vely long har@@ sh@@ ers like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to pull up a leg to help the self @-@ being British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
so perhaps some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tre@@ ati@@ se was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not have during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can still remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ering foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought like it , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him , rather than to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bla@@ ir had set up the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , thereby opening a backdoor .
the press has never passed it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly hook on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need to waste time for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the eigh@@ ties , an error back then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I am very friendly - in the development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ trend and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den von Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s nom@@ ination by prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as said Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Performance Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month interven@@ ed on the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which P@@ he argu@@ ed his most important conclusion .
two more scientists write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria Dec@@ ision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed BAT &apos;s testim@@ oni@@ als on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he was supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; suggests that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; P@@ he claims that &quot; there is no evidence until now that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to the tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year .
by exam@@ ining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says Channel 4 &apos;s former head
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ fought time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC program sends or transm@@ its programs that would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation of the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least make your production on programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programmes could be financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would have to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give back what former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , you all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who are for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only a few of BBC production would now be officially classified as an education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and deal with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulse .
scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound pulse , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically engineered to carry the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms highlighted the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms .
thread@@ worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made sure that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greet commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over Artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around the advertising for the trade fair - through a Le@@ erst@@ elle of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic sh@@ ady company advertisement , but &quot; by the blu@@ ei@@ vers with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a stepp@@ ing up of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will be fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tically products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have been angry - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ age , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just one yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your las@@ hes were firing in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear themselves and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if they were doing something , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , to go to her , to separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together friends to himself ?
of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
get a valuable and am@@ using lesson through plug@@ ging - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack their bel@@ ong@@ ings on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single travellers , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the ser@@ ge@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Guil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ aries : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people get into house blocks .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have consistently dra@@ gged my project into construction legally .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the placement arrangement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true is : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
I show how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS once Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message saying that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by adding the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process has been completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue since the phone may turn off half@@ way , and this could lead to an ab@@ ort of the update .

you should also ensure that before downloading , you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things to prevent things going wrong and protecting themselves if they do . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg has only one motto in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed ahead of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore this Sunday by title def@@ ender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite already won seven of the twelve races of the season and will also hit the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still un@@ clear .
a ha@@ ze bell has been hanging over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the 1st class and hon@@ orary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , which President Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ion@@ ft have te@@ amed up under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice from now on to questions such as health insurance or services of the health and nursing routes .
for years we have been setting up with our ambul@@ ant nursing care that often car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; also , many of the services of the insur@@ ances are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ is and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the &quot; Amadeus &quot; ambul@@ atory service .
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; was Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both managers see particularly in demographic change .
this is what makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure vital in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office dedicated itself to the club meeting in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ alising together . &quot;
this makes the Sozial@@ stiftung a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and good as possible in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Tourist office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose ab@@ rup@@ ture and bleeding strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove past several times demon@@ stra@@ tively .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a head@@ stock , one applied to the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical supplies .
until now , only a vag@@ ue work description is available .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs becomes mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will remain at half a point in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her medical training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and who wants to go into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Mul@@ ler liked the idea to pursue his own practice in As@@ endorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so they agreed that the gar@@ bage dump bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller also grew up there , followed by his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as senior consultant in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ir@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the remo@@ del@@ ing , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be given by the waste dump within the framework of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Bernd Bor@@ mann &apos;s mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients live in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers talk time , by the way , continue to look forward to familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock faces .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf , an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen sm@@ iling .
after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now it could become different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must complete its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to travel in eastern Croatia to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees ever arrived in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country is counting about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , bus@@ ses from Pres@@ evo would be on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , transferred to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually come to a slightly further west @-@ lying route to the predicted shift in the Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .

Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the reports of the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ ot@@ he Wednesday morning at a local ticket in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distribut@@ ing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of gaining insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ places and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were found in the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused could pers@@ ist in this case .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators shall have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people carry out their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ es , partly cosy bum@@ pers .
you control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city paths .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates each with the heading &quot; Before I die .... &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy attracted attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy stands for the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontane@@ ously intervene to the chal@@ k and read the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then continue .
again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy .
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the twenty @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tables , however , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .

the death and fun@@ eral atten@@ d@@ ant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
with personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy was looking for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and was involved in the formation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle their task and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training courses and super@@ visions of the mort@@ al and fun@@ eral atten@@ d@@ ants .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivering giant lowered its profit prospects to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
anal@@ ysts expected a pol@@ l of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ land transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve anal@@ ysts from Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six anal@@ ysts asked anal@@ ysts anticipated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought revenue in its unit express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at an end to the orn@@ ate two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices stable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ am@@ pered by the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets may make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and even by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue waiting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ able .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday D@@ ow Jones Industrial j@@ umped by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a rise in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and in the early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slo@@ wed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the year &apos;s target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered this month , and D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically when it comes to making decisions .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a rise in interest rate , c@@ ited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its Lei@@ tz@@ ins to 0.75 per@@ cent@@ points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Publ@@ ishers of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 references .
every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home at Dill@@ inger Strasse .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school .
Brazilian Pon@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society of Rio Grande fav@@ ours nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization , Spr@@ S , is sho@@ cking to explain how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert &apos;s Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council , Bern@@ ried , approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million gymn@@ asi@@ um .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited hall construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
previously , the panel had , among other things , approved an application for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof area for solar installations is the purpose of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was about the tendency to climb , which for reasons of energy - should be different than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
therefore , a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was necessary because the development plan for the attic did not allow &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s municipal council generally leaves more restri@@ ctive for exemp@@ tions from liber@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at gym construction , however , this is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sport promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall will now be submitted to the administrative office for testing .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Regional Hospital of the County , who confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this decision will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the more existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der &apos;s resig@@ nation , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of internal medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
if the supervisory board agre@@ es to the next two years , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves that both houses lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ claims that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations .
there are currently a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a day nur@@ sery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ bal@@ es of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are demanded ton@@ ight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to a crime of violence .
the bodies of the young woman were found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police shared on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be a suspect , who , in fact , stated the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when looking for a young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ained police arrested the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the dock on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation should take place on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the de@@ part@@ mental battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study on behalf of the association of &quot; Social Housing Construction . &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 flats are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first accommodation facility .
many then encounter the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is moving a deficit in front of itself , which will grow from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 housing units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason many professionals lived in large cities in need of share in shared rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults abo@@ de longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the housing market because of the flood on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capit@@ a has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incen@@ tives should boost the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved for the real estate tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats will be exposed .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Kf@@ W ( state bank Kf@@ W ) is already working well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , practically no enforcement is needed , more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that it will pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia is trying to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dep@@ ortation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people had come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the eve of the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also virtually eliminating ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media report@@ edly came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d by bus as well as with ta@@ xis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter f@@ ences .
for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly more refugees to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 36@@ 6 people at hand .
shortly before the gate was closed on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the over@@ coming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences ranging from prison sentences up to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves at the goal of this change .
only a few refugees arrive after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees gathered on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge firmly on Sunday we were occupied with clean rooms when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
but because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into Pass@@ au .
before that , we made the un@@ hoped guests only once more , with a snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; said Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers climbed from an ICE into a regional train in direction of Pass@@ au , in order to try the railway traffic to Germany after the short @-@ term announcement , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was turned off at the Inn before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ aly closed on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending thousands of tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , to ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; blessed land &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for shel@@ ters in us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ solid quarters
with the help of the refugees , Konrad has all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken hold of Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommo@@ dating of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units have to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be delivered to the federal states , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already been talking to the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating a qu@@ arti@@ ere for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clari@@ fied , as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also has great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the trans@@ duc@@ ers must hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the col@@ lars .
for a temporary period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
Konrad , with his experience , reas@@ oned that he was more successful in the opposition to the Interior Ministry .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause any costs to the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
up to now , its own district search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
the city of Linz is planning to prevent an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center to accommodate refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city chief on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a prolonged phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday has cor@@ rupted the further procedure in the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guar@@ di@@ ans , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Austria is again introducing checks at its borders , for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is drawn up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and also to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to post@@ p@@ one this project : finally , she has got an increase in the form of another business plan .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 Euro .
larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been reconstructed .
&quot; I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; Br@@ eit says .
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater Region of Linz selling this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am the most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women come into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert cannot answer last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called en@@ co@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it is alien@@ ated , journalists are concerned or gaps in the international crisis policy reveals - the applicant for the U.S. presidential office is boo@@ sting the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ al @-@ hair@@ style is a concept for many in the wine @-@ village on the wine @-@ road .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ town are related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , which besides Tr@@ ump also includes the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , I tend to think that tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in circulation , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ us Pac@@ em@@ akers &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , says it .
so tr@@ ump comes from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later Grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Folk Art , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a fron@@ tier to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like the reverse , it &apos;s not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a remote relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was borro@@ wed Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bri@@ dging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension whir@@ l@@ wind Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz at a visit ended up something for the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing in the United States at the time of his grand@@ father would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;

and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinema war@@ bler , also in the USA the interest is awakening .
the Upper Bavarian commun@@ e of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hands of Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson are rus@@ hing to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews of Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a weekly series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the Ab@@ bot seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , revealed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour the total was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery Rev@@ e@@ aled ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given a cl@@ ue to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers become a game spo@@ iler , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s house visit made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who would choose WO@@ OD , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broad@@ cast@@ ed to Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also confirmed Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian battle for his N@@ FL debut had hoped .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his orig@@ ami debut in 2007 , when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Que@@ ens@@ land T@@ ry .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W in Groß@@ gel@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get recru@@ itment in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day @-@ to @-@ day fraction meets in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free vot@@ ers meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the cl@@ aw , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia @-@ Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ gel@@ stadt will not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 gramm@@ ar schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level is tested by three to four years - in the end it will take nine years to complete .
but that is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gramm@@ ar schools .
free ride at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired .

many stock markets reck@@ on that markets until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline in the fut@@ ures markets will take place on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens of the nuclear phase has temporarily pressed the shares of R@@ WE on a record low and left deep traces in E@@ on .
according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies are missing 30 billion euros in provisions .

investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car figures were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were picked up again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced the launch of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt .
the papers for Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Ru@@ pe@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief of the district officers , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police employed tear gas and then fired into the air before they res@@ orted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately obvious why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ adhes@@ i say that new provinces being formed as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since 10 .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a controversial topic in Nepal that has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitu@@ tion@@ draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den youth centre Old Post is to be till@@ ed again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
planning is a mix of trade , commercial and living - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Alte Post@@ doc youth centre .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
wait for corresponding offers , that is , on the part of the city .
the investor in question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner of Big Street , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
P@@ ieve project : details lying on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
months were negoti@@ ated , bel@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small seaside near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective client , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company , presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who submitted sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y to the investors and management , Ralf Behr@@ ends said : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project , roughly ten to twelve million euros , has been in the discussion for months .
strong reactions among hor@@ n@@ beam owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
comment@@ ing on the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , Roberto Schulz lam@@ ents : &quot; that will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ le that over@@ looks all other au@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as many other project critics that traffic would increase greatly because of the planned size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus inv@@ itations must come to ensure that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends .
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Double Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to Colle@@ ct $ 11 Million for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise € 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey includes many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has exp@@ elled more than 4 million people this year .
many also flee from the war crushed Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reports of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ umb
for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric @-@ pass and gast@@ ric tu@@ b@@ ular formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained at those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment at around 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ sol@@ ed diabetes and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was entirely cured by only one percent and partially at only two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol generally better in the &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared also average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly ent@@ ailed their bodies with obesity and diabetes , it is really difficult to reverse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the flock of her youth , and this falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is glad that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim lands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 that swal@@ low alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 , reporting the poison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more frequent in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some inf@@ ants drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants visi@@ bly while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
YouTube videos show how young inf@@ ect@@ ants drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents report@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ las@@ hes can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in inf@@ ants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic@@ ity centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come about it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ las@@ hes of straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was taken into emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah ruled out her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had met her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade , in New York State , planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by extra@@ cting anti @-@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them out of their room .
the police examined the s@@ worn @-@ out plan as &quot; sch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; and proved disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the industrial area in the direction of the round@@ about , and it was too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about were stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he j@@ umped into the stern of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .

rum@@ or molecules : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic

D@@ ons increase guidance over Cel@@ tic to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Cel@@ tic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede on di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glas@@ gow , which was dismis@@ sed spontane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confron@@ tation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ed by Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes players better .
keeping together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully at January @-@ transfers
despite his comment@@ aries only a few weeks ago pointing out that he hur@@ ried a couple of January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new appro@@ ves and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with reference note
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires from Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been tort@@ ured for two years with a nu@@ is@@ ance ank@@ le and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not ques@@ tioned the integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es was glad to be &quot; un@@ happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es conc@@ edes that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cup games or le@@ agues , the games of this type won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is growing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the U@@ Ks , as the figures from the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ONS ) were shown .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than seats , a fla@@ w@@ less lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I &apos;m not allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the prisoner &apos;s story how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she acknowledged that she could &quot; have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he was going to do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police pursu@@ its to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a break in peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and catch me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is involved . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol inspec@@ tions and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards tried to spy him out and threat@@ ens to end the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t sw@@ ab rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had been held back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I am doing with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their nos@@ es because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it is going to be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L become co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I &apos;m saying makes them think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study near Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; shed his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated master Black Caviar , described the race tags treatment regime &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees wron@@ g@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been like yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it had so on the race day as well .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy re@@ counts ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called Cri@@ ticism at the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ ions &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ disgu@@ sted comment to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his crew and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring battles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our def@@ ensive System or Techni@@ que throughout the year , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy att@@ aches Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the match Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the blu@@ epr@@ ints .
when we mention it , it means that in one phase we will still meet them .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ beer with 200.000 $ b@@ ail according to drug delivery
a man who may have a lifel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released on a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100@@ kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina in the morning and later in Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , regi@@ sters daily with the police and stops at a start @-@ up of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

on Tuesday evening a truck driver was seriously injured in a col@@ lision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had brakes in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used a girl &apos;s phone to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ ist used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when it was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the dor@@ man@@ t H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used terms for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that the search was done on the computer by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the inc@@ ess@@ ant pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty as to the indictment to have in@@ consistent pictures of children on 14 June last year , viol@@ ating the obligations and not appearing before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g should not appear in the sexual offen@@ ders register , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; may be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are picked up off the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the locks left fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river border river Inn in Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic @-@ guns to the German side .
there they are taken into reception by German police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to federal police data , there were clearly more refugees arriving at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : drop@@ out of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart distributed warm marine air .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days .
storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD it is still possible to calculate in the Black Forest , the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd is doing it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
2015 is mainly to be seen in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations were ac@@ counted for by the Federal Office of Str@@ ength ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at the dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
R@@ üssel@@ sheim . Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time are among those .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and one stressed sporty GT version .
he entered the trade in the beginning of next year , then also as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan offspring wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is perfectly integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n design laid the front end of everything : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court granted right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , who had been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison complex between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose feet , had been transferred to a larger cell .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his prison term failed due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the country of Berlin .
but the judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for the compensation , a statement of compensation was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they only spoke in April of a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ nity because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a prison cell .
according to a Dec@@ ree of 2011 , un@@ deser@@ ving is also the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had att@@ ested a human @-@ un@@ worthy accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fight fights because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 bodies are not occupied in Te@@ gel because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what &apos;s coming to Germany ?
according to the testimony of the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we are creating that . &quot;
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different prognos@@ es between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable r@@ ents : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental price bond will fall out , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister for Development , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , wants to double the funding , currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s perspective is far too little : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
both scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the international society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turn : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise jobs .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence obligation , which restri@@ cts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the visibility is mostly en@@ forced by the fact that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market .
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contact .
therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that few fled parents spend their children in Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is growing rapidly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - for example , by allowing more vocational training schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes without knowledge of German .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated studying - the only exception to date was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned his stance .
student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a residence or toler@@ ation do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they start studying .
the latter do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to access .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , but also call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely place the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing State Church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to host religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in order for the majority society to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for over a decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NSU series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti@@ rac@@ ism convention will commit to Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medi@@ cally to the expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the new@@ com@@ ers to sign health tickets at the same time .
services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited power catalog that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors are mainly doing the language barriers .
until now , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are becoming more poor@@ ly informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , also in doctors &quot; offices , interpre@@ ters should be taken over , it calls for them .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ tra@@ ded disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV education .
with some of the rest of the disease German doctors come from her education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctor &apos;s angel , there may be even relief in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , and several refugees are even doctors .
however , in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can apply for a psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social @-@ offices generally non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal @-@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks in the Man@@ ege on the tile @-@ v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto stands the current stage production .
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ ually cocktail with cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the Cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family enter@@ tains the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with a sense of dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal protection organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes position as well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read off by the eyes as soon as possible .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the arena either .
so the highest command : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 audience , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
from the 17th to the 20th of September , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
it is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calling calls .
last month they had rested on him and suspended him during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; Tod &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the concerned Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on delivering un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to address the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused enterprises provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot already play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a pure medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere illnesses since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al ki@@ cks off his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will set up a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey didn &apos;t travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to get a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the hope of leading the association to his first European @-@ based triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 High School students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication carried out via social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health far more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ amed by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of that came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
as a member of the phone past@@ oral ministry explained to me ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the complete 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani in his matches against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League , di Maria is making his debut on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move past Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris St @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria found less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in group A , Paris also needs a strong start to the Swedish master , as it not only asp@@ ires to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First World League , but he was stab@@ bed to death by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who proposed Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and ended up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad connections , last but not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who at no less than five attempts came to the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria changed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute past the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had spotted a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended up with all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and within a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a door in the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Switzerland @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is affected by the fall in commodity prices , accumulated $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ enc@@ ore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ enc@@ ores &apos;s share price on trading early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the $ 2.5 billion in stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to wi@@ pe around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
in the morning , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long run .
the refugees are from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngest descend@@ ant is a six month old girl from Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House Con@@ fir@@ ts X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings Visit in Washington
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and ref@@ utes President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have held bilateral discussions .
&quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will give the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to construct dis@@ agreements in a constructive manner , &quot; adds the statement .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before traveling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and his increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
some years ago FC Bayern was standing shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner of cup , four times Champions League winner , two times Champion World Champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in those days , Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; he says .
and the registered FC Bayern also registered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason why X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contra@@ cted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; that is what he has given me . &quot;

matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in filling the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments by the actor of The Mar@@ tian secured themselves .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer group Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white plu@@ mage .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights in the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direc@@ ting &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded prior to endor@@ sement of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved country @-@ wide effect and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured restra@@ int .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated Albums of the Year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News @-@ Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mos@@ cu@@ ffs who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished off its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant , who was able to finish all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete completing the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with e ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get some prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great gra@@ tification .
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he &apos;s such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tiger Grin@@ der past Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the Twin@@ s wast@@ ed a chance to climb within one half of the Houston branch for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Det@@ roit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Det@@ roit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings 6 times and made three races possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go quite focused into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first races since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the impact wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke ) , looked much better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in mind at the end of the seventh inside the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who broke a two @-@ run on the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive year in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Det@@ roit added a Garden @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ roit prof@@ ited from the beginning of the game by a non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tiger obtained three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers finished in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big hit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Twin@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
in Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated S@@ hou@@ lder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .

Frankfurt and Han@@ au also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive consideration of military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he pre@@ clu@@ ded the European states &quot; collective sight . &quot;
four years ago , we had been glad that the cup passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid locally for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one would be sent back to Hungary .
even Germany has not returned refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees crossed the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun by border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states haven &apos;t been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on late Tuesday evening after almost four hour deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , wear them too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view has been unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania can be hed@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
room Sun &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the spatial probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
the moon is therefore slightly stag@@ gering on its rail@@ road around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is written in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered Eis@@ volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds that sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared .

the 1860 München has to wai@@ ve Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us heavy , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , we must think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less pro@@ s .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to its slender line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it soft@@ ens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first con@@ cili@@ ation@@ ist , then striking cold front
the night falls in the valleys of the alpine region of the F@@ öhn through , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz reported on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows with storm strength through the cili@@ ators .
after returning on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the foref@@ ront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the mountain@@ side @-@ side breaks in the night to the Wednesday of the fo@@ eh@@ n through the valleys .
in the wake of the fo@@ eh@@ n until Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ atory valleys with gu@@ es@@ thou@@ ses from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to pass through to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer leaves for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to sto@@ w at the mountain @-@ hill @-@ slope .
the rain starts here , which will last until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be reck@@ oned with , after a large amount of ra@@ inf@@ all has fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the hair dri@@ es out , in the wake of a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind quickly e@@ ats up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in seclu@@ sion through centuries as a minority .
with this place , it is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) lived in Rome for several months as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city as a sin@@ ful sin @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther began the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt scrip@@ ture , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
cycles that deal with topics such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity are created .
this makes it spontane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into current contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this gives the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler of Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter .
&quot; that &apos;s what the up@@ bringing happened with the cane stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on it , perhaps to get me back with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterized by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt aims to let the viewer fall into the images , let them look , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art has always been : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not been honored to fully grasp the Bible , but rather select the mysterious themes that are important to him .
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we go about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; the result was a picture Bible .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction work started for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , companies commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already enough .
failures in politics and administration caused a lot of pity , especially among residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
so hill desc@@ ended , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission was received in October , the first church expert Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies refugees &apos; commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga illustrates a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policies to tackle the problems arising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have ensured over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach announced at the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal authorities also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign when they will be on the left tri@@ cot seat instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler der &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be able to use our radiation , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship Quali@@ fication Game on this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; a big common work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year and next year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the association will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses an eye in the event of an accident
bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , head of Europe &apos;s largest software company , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bled , was power@@ less , then he was dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us this last week , &quot; c@@ ited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is involved in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fully here for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to come to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to wake up once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of Marco Re@@ us &apos;s com@@ eback in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its headquarters on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; the football team praised the World Champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller used to be used in all of Europe &apos;s league games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
with a high lik@@ eli@@ hood , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ge statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final campaign for the BV@@ B must be the goal in the Europa League will be understandable by middle @-@ field players Julian Wei@@ gl . &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ echan@@ ika I@@ AA of a &quot; new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 States , who come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport under@@ lines , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio stations .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; check and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only fores@@ ees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , car@@ eless vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study will appreciate the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany by 2025 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the drivers &quot; personal data must be un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clari@@ fied .
the Germans , however , are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the International Motor Show of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on with autonomous cars by 2025 , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital verb@@ ands Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each Fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll puts team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM ab
according to current status , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only pick up in sing@@ les from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is to fall at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; says the German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf .
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who launches the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo also lack@@ ed that time , and we &apos;re European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on that , &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth List Fi@@ fth .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine gr@@ us@@ el@@ ab@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became a big star in fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection previously made it to the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work for which a lot of effort was carried out : in order to re@@ fresh the dol@@ ls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the Syrian Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material have gone to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as Mode @-@ N@@ ish
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the cl@@ amps Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and at regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing potential for the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
fashion store Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ alers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
nowadays , mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
moreover , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery pearl in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ ik@@ es .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly modified to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sho@@ cks little chi@@ cks in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; before that , I could not do anything with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the governance of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should dedic@@ ate itself to attra@@ cting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published following the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus en@@ force consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding work paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerves for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ common .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ti@@ ghten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; plo@@ wing , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p tend to be so low that they hold the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for humans , which is enriched by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; especially in case of un@@ born damage .
the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury comes primarily through coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written reference to the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount consumed in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , e.g. in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide sur@@ passed , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; c@@ ited out of paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
