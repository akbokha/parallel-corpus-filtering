Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but in the encounter it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the perpet@@ u@@ ating settlement of Israel and presents Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot to have shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made a fatal emergency at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police at Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to a job as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of girl@@ friend Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar match .
he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm at that time .
all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ ing audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students , and members of the community participated in a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony on Tuesday evening .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the Univers@@ itat &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb was designated as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox S@@ hear about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it seems to me that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wning and a length of length of it , with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss calls for once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the cop@@ ing of the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks with surveys down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps &apos;s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has established last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans see Tr@@ ump temp@@ er not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ atory statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers tend to believe that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first state of state Io@@ wa , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse into the White House so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they impose their vo@@ ws , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers will be seen as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is sm@@ ashing almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the lead , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support .
he has 15 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump named immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is crucial to prevent His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive apartment complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers one square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living well @-@ being , one of the prices comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well known .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
triple Tor@@ ri@@ cher in Pira@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a barrel .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze made a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the wit@@ ches of Pira@@ eus .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
in his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller received good assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination , without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were gra@@ c@@ efully ran , but in their aggressive endeav@@ ours , they were often too imagin@@ ative .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , when the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct tak@@ eover , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although Bavaria moved her usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to put a needle stal@@ k .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was aband@@ on@@ ment .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola had defended a fourth chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Gö@@ tze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
the World Cup Her@@ o was given a green light only after the final training , &quot; said sports manager Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the s@@ worn Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later . Müller still put one on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went out with stro@@ kes against the Munich pendant .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ term Study .
the good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of dental loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val inflammation in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated study manager H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the high age according to our findings .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of dental pl@@ essness distributed the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological finds were made .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the Stadt@@ district Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a department for arch@@ eological excav@@ ations .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now fifth .
from text documents it was already known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
apart from remaining the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman died at the train station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for assistance .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the train station and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , she has suffered severe injuries according to the Federal Police .
it was treated emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue staff .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private scho@@ oling facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is to develop the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries .
for the first time , there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed among themselves on arbit@@ rators , a claim to claim their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding mainly of large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies can dispute damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations like Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to Canada ( C@@ eta ) negoti@@ ated free trade agreement .
the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned that the economies of the economy restrict the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called .
when the negotiations on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US yet .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting folk singers filmed the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; appear wis@@ ely composed songs , which harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent dri@@ fting .
the rum@@ or of &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should follow .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans already appeared and had a positive outlook .
in this case St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece is published in 2005 .
over@@ flowing with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
after an extremely productive experiment St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic assembly pieces .
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs grew up , the stage shows are presented here to the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on fron@@ tal bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger of Hamburg More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; available since March .
even though nearly 2,000 guests are sitting in their chairs now , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide enriched album .
from the audience , one h@@ ears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and it is possible to throw the &quot; plate on the bottom . &quot;
only to an enc@@ ore thanks St@@ ev@@ ens humble , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually tends out under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire with sus@@ pen@@ se
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and prepare for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour president &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , said in the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary party originally supported it as a guide .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements to the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are preparing to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and assistant minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory Head , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the Unter@@ haus , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later he cleared up that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was viewed as the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdi@@ ct of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position under his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argu@@ ed that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and op@@ poses far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was spr@@ ing@@ ling according to data that showed an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est rate in 2009 over the time of an increase in interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported again growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took US $ 2.5 billion by selling stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of Mond@@ i &apos;s packaging and paper company Mond@@ i were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decrease by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sport@@ swear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

and with each doll that looks like it and about the counter , Bie@@ ber is also assi@@ mil@@ ated .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are aston@@ ished at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others stress , Bie@@ ber is finally right in the USA and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in place 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or d@@ öner ?
it is both in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ary Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of the d@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster with a p@@ eg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television .
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has meanwhile registered to the Leban@@ ese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y it .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also benefits from its customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground link@@ age campaign to tackle al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and retail owners who sell endor@@ sed tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publ@@ ishes further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investors strategy day .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia have almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after the opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost a $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s are sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which accounts for approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in sales and margins at the same time .
however , the wholes@@ aler ref@@ uses to invest over $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading remedi@@ ation programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; special Ks , &quot; became spot@@ light by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ er , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp se@@ duc@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the solo behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite en@@ vious is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged down a little into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t have a problem with the other players , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Cy@@ gios during the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick made very fast the climb , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his action . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stop , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ells ins@@ ults against the Hungarian supply police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were derived from Prot@@ est food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ block at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could agree .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a swift action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency stood on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison mates were used in race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government left along the southern border to Serbia to a crime . these laws also place higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come down by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody , and are accused of committ@@ ing crimes according to the new laws .
in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled to the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is certain which candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders only res@@ ides here with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
however , Clinton still has a big advantage in the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the elections would say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some privileges and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common response that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and sel@@ ections are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to the last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in vot@@ ers of the elections of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best trimm@@ ed by the three candidates for hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic vot@@ ers of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be placed as an external minister during the term as an external minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public altogether .
half of Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of vot@@ ers do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of vot@@ ers vote nation@@ wide as well as tr@@ ump and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership .
from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will best cut hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the previous elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic impact on the two candidates
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump with rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell on the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - with 19 % support in rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s belief in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East there is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings
almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police dealt with .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically ordered the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Poli@@ sig@@ nor Wagner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has repeatedly been inf@@ lic@@ ted with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year to the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ formally - this has been sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rise in interest comes , and the domestic market is getting into fuel , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on raising the interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to decrease assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study to what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is mostly in the upward trend in the past 35 years - roughly 14 per cent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of Plant Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and return on return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases are often promoting them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which did not exist before and which could speed up a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants enjoyed the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all hei@@ ghtened cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on pre @-@ recession heights are very fast placed after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the solid income was also volati@@ le , as the market has anticipated a rise in zinc , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
for bonds , the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the excav@@ ation cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interesting is that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , bor@@ rowing has expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed shar@@ pen its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really think it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that it was harder to work harder to engage the public when it did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to step into the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory Member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it star@@ es for the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fees pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales were slower in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slo@@ wed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales index on the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is a one , and we may experience that growth less@@ ens .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers hold their purchases before this event , which will be held last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers left their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 issues have been issued a little more than 1 £ online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being conducted via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - B@@ in Lad@@ ens &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims at first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially att@@ aches to the collapse of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead appeared their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king ruled over the construction company of B@@ in Laden because of the catastrophe which left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction suspended .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dr@@ unk@@ ers who were killed as a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mo@@ z@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
under the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was supported .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the B@@ in Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ les , who later took place this month , were gathered .
the B@@ in Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also included the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the B@@ in Laden Group .
B@@ in Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million pounds ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City CEO correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home
if you are sk@@ il@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices has now over@@ taken .
therefore King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are met by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate with the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to post@@ p@@ one this to a balance .
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of five leading companies in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ stru@@ cts her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher announced a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group o@@ wed the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dep@@ ortation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial failures .
this fact gave up the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argu@@ ed that the association was at no time an asset .
the sports function@@ aries had calculated only expenses and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the passi@@ va bet@@ ru@@ gen in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( about 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put money to put our li@@ fest@@ y@@ les as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts .
furthermore , in case of corresponding financial success , the pay@@ out of the expenses compensation was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore one has paid a part of the exp@@ ul@@ sion damages only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus has been on the account .
for this reason , flat formwork and non @-@ detail statements appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books jointly managed the two def@@ end@@ ants , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not dis@@ closed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the financial result , it is important that the freedom of debt has been so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , against the official abuse of official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to its statement to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim repar@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first accused stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never made any damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the function@@ ary said he never had a c@@ ents salary , he merely charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were unable to present exact documents for the early years .
these are after an operating test , in which everything had been judged correctly , did not have been kept , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all the dwell@@ ings were settled in cash , in order to do so , he explained in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard takes another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the number of personnel cuts that have been running for three years , the company will disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the actuators at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the disman@@ tling of 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had about 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share was 2.3 percent .
the large group of printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto are currently split up : this is how the computer and printer store will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , last one of the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturers .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split @-@ up and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more stores right now .
in total , Whit@@ mans restructuring plans show the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the Anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly reject rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 per cent agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ thro@@ wer against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water @-@ thro@@ wer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first put an un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly chil@@ ly spray .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now declined slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. emergency database
the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates will last at the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest sat on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 PM ME@@ Z on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University leave debt letter
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and later on the day he killed his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; issued authorities on Tuesday .
the police at Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency call for 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; K@@ now@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called up relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate in the Delta State University as his CV on the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has double leg fra@@ cture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then played fantastic , and then that happens .
in the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have double frac@@ tures , then the six months will take , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister op@@ ted for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems to always have a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead describes a summary of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets his desire to see a real tree , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was silent and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agre@@ es to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment due to the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fies , Th@@ need stri@@ pping On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name of the name of the name of the name of the trees , is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a single child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election circular office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , but a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that &apos;s not surprising me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test hit gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation you can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a bu@@ zz@@ ler which I set up high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin bowl and get four qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred laps immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ u if the economy is in a fl@@ au@@ te by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s rest@@ ful re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was viol@@ ated on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the Self@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers might even inten@@ tionally not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tre@@ ati@@ se was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his refin@@ ement Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic , who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set up the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which thus opened a backdoor .
the press has never been able to pull it out .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th years , a mistake back then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ dest fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment was a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ th years when his old father turned himself on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on the N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats are required to try to find in everything a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn out political capital - they also have di@@ str@@ au@@ cal vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose out of a meeting of 12 people , partly with compounds to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; where he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary decision @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions about the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Factory ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the p@@ he &apos;s tobacco leadership took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to the tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system two billion £ a year .
due to the clear indication of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ward , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ering and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term is not for a good idea , one should at least make its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must see myself how this should be public @-@ right television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , conducted channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ er- should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value .
of course you are all thinking that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be an example of the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with the commercial channels of alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by dis@@ rup@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction of the moment in which they have sound impulses , which have to be heard for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells that are genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of them carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons using impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can be un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily stop the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

according to G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists are working with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons tra@@ ps sal@@ utes the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a Le@@ erst@@ elle of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ffs with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have sharpen@@ ed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ absor@@ bing to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your las@@ hes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and take their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
to kno@@ ck out : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I asked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
check this with the owner of the milk .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with still loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , to join them again and then see them every day and perhaps experience how to move all together friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart walks through its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk about your lower abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good horse is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never lose someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Solo@@ ists , Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ dien@@ ne
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ dien@@ er alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space for the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in apartment blocks .
each of the six homes currently being built in the pilot project consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have successfully passed my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the slot arrangement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not ti@@ ghten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the ger@@ min@@ er alone .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type in &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able through the dis@@ integration of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue since the phone may turn off at half way and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the update .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday by title def@@ ender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races of the season and won the Fl@@ ut@@ licht Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in the attack .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still un@@ clear .
for days , a Dun@@ st@@ glo@@ cke is hanging over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who kept himself in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the German Service Cross 1st Class and Ehr@@ enb@@ ür@@ ger of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the Social Foundation &apos;s coat and opened a new office at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consulting , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice seek@@ ers will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care providers .
for years we have established an out@@ patient care service that often nursing members are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; many of the benefits of the insur@@ ances are not in@@ frequently claimed , because the complexity of insurance is scar@@ cely understood , &quot; explained the new home owner J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because this is a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able presence . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent as possible and live in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10@@ am to 12@@ pm .

it is something special for our team to play against a third @-@ party .

on the other hand , he has not appe@@ aled .
in the Bre@@ mer downtown area , the meadow had just cut the hair@@ s when he saw how outside a parking space guard exhibited a bal@@ lot for his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meadow rus@@ hed out of the business , off@@ ended the civil servants , and threw it in front of the feet as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ g@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not .

witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young people , and struck this with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ throat and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs , he first dismis@@ sed from his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove demon@@ stra@@ tively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
you can check the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim with the help of a stroke .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far , there is only a vag@@ ue perpet@@ ual description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a position in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock faces met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to conduct his own practice in As@@ endorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage dump bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage cans , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle as household doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ related EC@@ Gs and need a microphone room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 500@@ 00 Euros will get the gar@@ bage dump within the framework of a funding programme of the local district ( 25@@ ,000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have been found , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , look forward to the familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock faces take over .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medical profession has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen sm@@ iles .
a little melanch@@ oly already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants asylum application will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia ref@@ uses &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an outside border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not want to factory its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government rus@@ hed , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours for Tuesday , in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country has around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , bus@@ ses from Pres@@ evo were sent to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , led to Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do it , &quot; it was .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , the predicted shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic emphasized that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have made a good testimony to the country since then , as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday at a local notice in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative ro@@ aches of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature death .
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime that is accused of having acquired insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business wire , marketing and PR news@@ wire since 2010 .
with the information collected , insi@@ der businesses should have been made in the financial markets .
in this way , the investig@@ ators were report@@ edly caught up over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other def@@ end@@ ants continued in the event .
most of the accused originate from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators should have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their concerns , partly fast pac@@ es , partly comfortable stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with magnificent autumn sunshine and four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid made aware of this action on its twenty @-@ year existence and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is also available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and discussions like the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant attacks spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others will be short , read , say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again on the ver@@ ge of little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itan Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 year old .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tables is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although precisely the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the fact that people are opening up .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and fun@@ eral service belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid sought an hon@@ orary official by calling an hon@@ orary official , she immediately reported and was involved in the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent .
they are all well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as trainings and super@@ visions of the mort@@ al and fun@@ eral service .
every two years training is offered for new employees .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there are also other personal wishes to be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant saw its profit outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ transport service .
the company also said that she plans to present about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
anal@@ ysts expected a pol@@ l set of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it was nevertheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings will take into account the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , like the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s anal@@ ysts expected € 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit posted higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the years Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spend two days this week sitting round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story seating area is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive due to the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets will make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase of interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of raising .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slo@@ wed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it due to tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the high end of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred during the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. emergency database .
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process technically .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dissolved del@@ usions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a rise in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its lead to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis , such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Resolution of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly won &apos;t get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should be expected at the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 sequences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er heim at Dill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is the very different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazilian Pon@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should perform .
a recent study led by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymnas@@ tics building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent church meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
the committee had previously decided to apply a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered First and roof top &quot; should be erected .
in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is : &quot; thus we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it was necessary to lay under ten degrees in different ways than in the building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the roof slope does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rule of liberation movement rather restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gymnas@@ tics hall is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and latitude transport .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the Council Office for the examination .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision about this is the Supervisory Board , and the meeting on Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 , and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner station .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree with both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is supposed to be defini@@ tively closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .

hunting case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvest in the afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police rus@@ hed .
after a shot , 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the criminal police determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to kill the young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in rock enh@@ ausen .
since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police informed on Wednesday .
at the Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also deemed to have been susp@@ icious , who indeed stated the indication , and the investig@@ ator was the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the evening .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally revealed .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities were inter@@ rog@@ ated by the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him .
conclusions about the near@@ ness of the act are to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long ago begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing . &quot;
for comparison : in this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency shelter .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures .
the study also makes considerable failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a residential deficit in front of itself , which will grow from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ aining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ with@@ standing in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a in recent years has sunk again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incen@@ tives are to revi@@ ve social housing .
this would not be necessary to wai@@ ve the atro@@ city tax and be exposed to the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats .
furthermore , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee camps of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was launched on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be exposed .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align cor@@ ridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , there more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the transit through Slovenia is not allowed to go north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television calendar RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws that entered into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus as well as with taxes in the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not viol@@ ate border f@@ ences .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , no more refugees come after the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 36@@ 6 challenged people .
shortly before closing on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage to the border fence as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentences up to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees there .
however , no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the gar@@ bage which had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
lock@@ ers were disman@@ tled and one of the record stores in the border place was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany was surprised at the end of Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
prior to that , we made the un@@ hoped guests only once , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE to Pass@@ au , after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was put down before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing generally is high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably soci@@ alized , a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of assi@@ sting in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away with the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has moved up officially and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who invited them and welcomed us is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flow and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the look@@ out for 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ resistant quar@@ ts
Konrad has fully to do with the refugee camps .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to establish quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20.000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to create qu@@ arti@@ ere even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have great expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ en@@ ders need to hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the upper classes .
&quot; emergency standards &quot; must be considered for a temporary period .
in contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , he founded Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er no longer cause the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the own quot@@ a search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better division
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because the affected persons are currently under@@ going these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for an emergency , other sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the City Council on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has added further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special suits with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again Austria has taken control of its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to accum@@ ulate .
from the very outs@@ et , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual surface in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now gained growth in the form of another business plan .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks had been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , were done by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big hall of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given inc@@ ub@@ ation from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also answer the professional woman with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgra@@ ding every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself on a foreign @-@ hostile , journalist , or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a concept for many in the village of Win@@ zer@@ dorf .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow thr@@ illing , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , they say .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the en@@ coder .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold graves in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland failed at the Bavarian State to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ orial History and People &apos;s Dog@@ s , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; he is always so bri@@ dging . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he doesn &apos;t get the choice because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 kin@@ og@@ gers , also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .
the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews of Today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a single week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed over the last few months .
in August Today , on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
in September Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outcome of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit the block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was full 7@@ 20.000 .
hot @-@ Seat average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident N@@ ine agre@@ es that Hot @-@ Seat will end up at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that failed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three voices agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was covered in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be able to see if she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may be acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until final on Thursday
all three women have left a ly@@ rical way of why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a deci@@ de@@ dly between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest in his rel@@ ocation to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a t@@ int as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er sports rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Suite for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gay people
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s most rich man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian roll field with arms .
after having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned to conf@@ is@@ cate his oil company Yu@@ kos and under@@ mine his democratic efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free vot@@ ers demand the recru@@ itment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get er@@ ections in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free vot@@ ers conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , all other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ ers meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the cl@@ ut@@ or@@ ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protected zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum situations : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot;
but the state policy in large @-@ scale city should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing long @-@ term tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level of three will be tested for four years .
but that &apos;s not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the gramm@@ ar schools that want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market has closed for a long @-@ distance and nervous trade course with profits .

in the USA , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently noted around 1 percent in the plus .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to step up until after the interest decision in the US and also to the great decline in the terminal on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens of the nuclear outbreak has pushed the shares of R@@ WE in the meantime to record a record level and leave a deep mark on E@@ on .
according to the &quot; Spiegel &quot; German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend .
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were dropped again than in the year @-@ earlier period , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt .

4 People killed after police shoot Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber @-@ fin in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Deputy District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they res@@ orted to rubber fin .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber fin , of which is known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ erg@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city currently prepar@@ es everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
the plan is a mix of trade , commercial and living - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct vicinity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , called it by the city .
which investor may be ques@@ tioned is not yet clear .
no contracts were concluded accordingly .
the city Em@@ den had a part of the property that lies on the ring road / corner of Große Straße , already purchased a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
some investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors had been negoti@@ ated , cast@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ im company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which aimed to investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went into the offensive by the system building management board : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
about ten to twelve million euro expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction were called forth by violent reactions among sea @-@ owners who came to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and board member in advoc@@ acy of advoc@@ acy , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other au@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus inv@@ itations so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans were still vari@@ ably variable .
welcome offspring at Gor@@ illas in Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt zoo is looking forward to young people with his gor@@ illas .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many also escape from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ umb
for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bel@@ ing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison to this , diabetes was completely dissolved only by one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical treatment group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who undergo a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is currently gaining attention in Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and im@@ percep@@ tible , meets after years the flock of her youth , and he falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in taking hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
poison control centers in the US report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , swal@@ lowing strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reported the poison control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children inten@@ tionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ iny in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be fed by attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ las@@ hes can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , especially in small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Ven@@ om Emer@@ gency Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come from it then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sp@@ las@@ hes of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and met his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; said a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; Ges@@ certain@@ tz &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ed Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now points out clearly at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes players better .
now to stand together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ks
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ker@@ le if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to twist things - but it is clear that the down@@ fall has to end up on the playing field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys el@@ f@@ m in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in po@@ kal or ey@@ eli@@ ds , the games of that kind also won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
she understood that she could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood that it is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after feu@@ dal police pursu@@ its persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday at a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what best for the racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt sw@@ ab rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they certainly should touch their nos@@ es because they have failed in trying to write me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think it &apos;s personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ beaten master Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly borne mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it had also happened on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy goes back against ri@@ vals due to claims for ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; Com@@ peti@@ tive Com@@ peti@@ tions &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard @-@ be@@ ware note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring matches when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not give points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit for drug ad@@ diction
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay coming from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that he could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the official declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released for a security deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , which is reported daily by the police and is holding an exit barrier between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driving cab apart
during a col@@ lision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slo@@ wed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police rus@@ hed .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from 6 hours to 2 pm .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to l@@ ure P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a P@@ äd@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , moved into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for the search for un@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and then he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ ble and on we@@ eping .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the indictment to have un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to be published in court at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; may be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October to get background reports about social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit , but was kept in custody account for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
it was recorded before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tu@@ gs devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks were made of fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn district since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam to the German side .
there they are taken by federal police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week , more refugees met at Munich Central Station in comparison with the start of the week .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : drop@@ out of Trop@@ ical Storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest Exp@@ ected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm @-@ birds in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the runner of the stal@@ k &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD it is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the ground @-@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 mph .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the cars at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is especially moving to the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations were ac@@ counted for by the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ esse also offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi station , which can also be seen at the I@@ AA .
and what will be done next to the Astra on the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial system of Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer was transferred to a larger cell .
his position of arrest due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court took up the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
the Chamber of App@@ eal now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of arrest for compensation were decisive for compensation , a compensation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners .
only in April they spoke to a prisoner of compensation because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude .
according to a decision of 2011 , human @-@ un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
on Wednesday , in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
for this reason , prisoners are always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to pun@@ ches it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young children , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different prognos@@ es between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable ten@@ ants : each year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a promotion of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the intake society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political turn : from the prohibition of labour to refugees for recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential light , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the visibility is carried out mostly by the fact that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for the access to the labour market is missing German knowledge .
until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important for the young parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diagra@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators grow strongly through the large number of refugees , the Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Be@@ ate St@@ ores says of the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) , but has given up his position .
student @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or Dul@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start studying .
the latter are basically not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to use .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span short@@ ens to 15 months .
but this gap has to be closed , but also calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely swe@@ ep the same rights as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state churches law to a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who professionally takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to host religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to put such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately left their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a universal equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU assass@@ ination series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored rac@@ ist motive .
the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international tre@@ aties such as anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention in Germany have to become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to previously expected refugees , Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the new@@ com@@ ers to sign up with the registration of health tickets .
the services rendered could be settled later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited power catalog that fores@@ ees the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors are doing the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , nor in medical practices should be taken over by interpre@@ ters , it demands .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
however , with the partially different disease images , German doctors would come from her education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take out tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ra@@ mps and death fears .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ghtening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social services , experts or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness decide whether or not a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst attacks the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal @-@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ in@@ ist and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto stands the current production stage .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ egen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to absorb it loose .
ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulation .
balance the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake men fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and intri@@ gu@@ ed with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if we don &apos;t care for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes upon the possibility of each wish .
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena .
so the top priority is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a nest and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the animal show is also open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ án .
last month they had hidden him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; Tod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members concerned that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s declaration .
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electro @-@ plants and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t already play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the wider image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an abnormal period of time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns out a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and to treat the players they need to break a little break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more frequent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often with@@ hold back fully their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of the phone past@@ oral care I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ murder has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term control mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a boun@@ ty at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in the group A , Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish masters , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t yet reached one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team who was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic hit in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes referred to , with some mis@@ fortun@@ es and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot which was hang@@ ed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had refres@@ hed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this completed all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars from stock sales on Wednesday as part of its huge debt reduction plan .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ in order to rep@@ ay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , is fighting with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and is devastating in markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Gl@@ enc@@ ores &apos;s share price on the trade in the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more extensive plans to wi@@ pe around one third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have decreased iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and resist@@ s President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be the host of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to construct areas of dis@@ agreements constructive , &quot; adds the statement .
XI , which was announced first in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington , before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Me@@ ers .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europe champion X@@ avi plays for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago , before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now advis@@ es that he was already standing before the EM 2008 f@@ arewell from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken care of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds made out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the top @-@ class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need of alternative perspectives and in regards to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the occupation of the film and not with the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with mis@@ erable un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian joined .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove beaten by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WHITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation is in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nation@@ wide effect and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against the subject matter .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; album silent matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in younger days , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , namely in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media sites that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
the competition show that completed its 7th season had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within time with which he finished the first ath@@ lete , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great gra@@ tification .
I don &apos;t think that he swe@@ eps any gru@@ dge over this .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an eighth season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s had a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Det@@ roit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained its early offensive support , when Det@@ roit scores three times in the first two inner ings , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ dog Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two branches , his first race since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swe@@ pt the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good out of the ( stroke training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inside the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who plan a Two @-@ Run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Det@@ roit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inner , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Det@@ roit benef@@ ited from the start of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had missing more than one month due to a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first of the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers finished in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big hit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Twin@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the Wur@@ f@@ schul@@ ter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who are anger@@ ed in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .

also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he rejected the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective path @-@ looking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we had been glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance locally for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , to Hungary nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun by passing border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery of Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , conf@@ use them too .
but those who do not have a lead perspective could not stay in Germany .
this view was expressed in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now be a &quot; huge force effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to block the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from expanding over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , because of e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .
room son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ apped .
this includes researchers from observations of the room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon sli@@ ps easily on his train around the ring plan@@ ets .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ inning the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers were joined at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich has to ren@@ ounce around a month on offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an investigation .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich lion , the diagnosis is estimated to be four weeks &apos; break break &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible obligation of a uni@@ form@@ less pro@@ s .
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ ensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ jäger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie will return to the team training next week .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game near Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent cl@@ ash on the head .
contrary to the first concerns , however , he remained without a grave cens@@ or@@ ship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too solid and pleas@@ antly cra@@ wling .
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special note .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm strength through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind arches and a temperature drop .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow .
on the mountain@@ side @-@ side breaks in the night to Wednesday of the F@@ öhn through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ atory valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to sto@@ w at the mountain &apos;s slope .
here rain sets out , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after in recent days has already fallen large amounts of rain .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds up the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind swe@@ eps strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German reform@@ ator on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutscher The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working group of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries .
in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the town as a sin@@ ful sin @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
his negative impressions should have followed him in the opinion of histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther had initiated the division of the Dutch church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it may seem quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that deal with topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood .
with this he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages .
he interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Ot@@ mar , and thus transl@@ ates into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is influenced today by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have some myst@@ eries and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers &quot; fall into the images , &quot; let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not taken care of the Bible to fully grasp the Bible , but it has chosen mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was already at the end .
failures in politics and administration were responsible for dr@@ ink@@ ering , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
so hills dep@@ orted , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be published in October , the first church leader Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then begin without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the p@@ aving situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policies to tackle the problems facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the state minister Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can help and want to help .
but the crucial course must be the policy .
the German Football League therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pro clubs set a clear sign when they will help on the left @-@ hand tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football team , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and next year , the association will jointly present 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board loses an eye in accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was impot@@ ent , then he left the road - that he told us the last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fully for SAP in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;

it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fall down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller at the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League will definitely be sm@@ ashed .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
due to the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its headquarters on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the por@@ ter &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of the tribe of Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open to the future in all Europe league games in the future .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the European League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Marco Wei@@ gl for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so false . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at Frankfurt at the edge of the I@@ AA car fair from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport empha@@ sizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio stations .
a test track at the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that previously only sees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increases the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , car@@ eless vehicles are expected to be expected in public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the A@@ AA conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test procedure Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe at all at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the whole journey across all roads .
on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each V@@ et would leave the car the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll tells Team and Double Rel@@ aun@@ ching at Table Tennis @-@ EM
according to current standards , Düssel@@ dorfer wants to only hit the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , only in sing@@ les .
the final decision is scheduled to fall on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Individual Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World Ran@@ king List . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has attracted a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became a big star in fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ther . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was run : to re@@ fresh the dol@@ ls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
14 tons of material have ar@@ isen the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashionable Geh@@ rig of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the Pl@@ auen lace fashion played a major role , then it was displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bul@@ ls , is an increasing potential .
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they must carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken .
there are almost no private shops and wholesale stores .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper nowadays in Asia and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also weaker export , currently in Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sho@@ cks small chi@@ cks in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Pl@@ auen lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she pre@@ tends the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the United States , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and who would like to have a reminder .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic kid girl .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies that cannot be ques@@ tioned for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since they assign the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal state business environment and designed the market , the statement said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas of private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the law of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli attended , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to exploit the consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve end@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve region for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be disp@@ le@@ ased .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p tend to be so low so low that they already comply with the planned highest values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering at Kl@@ on@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal for the human being , which is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury proceeds primarily through coal burning into the environment .
according to a written reference to the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount represented in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; c@@ ited from paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
