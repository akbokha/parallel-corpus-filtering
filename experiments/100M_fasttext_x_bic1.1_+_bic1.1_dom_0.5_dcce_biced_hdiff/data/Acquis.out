&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I regarding securing measures .
the aim of the preventive measures defined in this agreement is to detect significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such degradation by the risk of premature discovery .
for the sub@@ stitution of the target set in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with the spatial inclusion and observation as important supple@@ mental measures .
the technical conclusion of the test carried out by the organization is made by an explanation , in which the quantity of material not shown for a specific period of time is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out its scrut@@ iny , the organisation pursu@@ es after Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown of material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community of de procedures and measures shall make use of the following kind and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age as it is intended to be further determined and condu@@ ci@@ ve to the supple@@ mental agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the assessment of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of appropri@@ ations of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which exhibits the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance area for each material balance zone , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures according to this Convention shall not extend to material in the mining industry or in the ore treatment .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the entered phase of the nuclear cycle circuit , is introduced into the States , so the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not established for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ane enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is made , or will be introduced into the States in a later phase of the core material cycle , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The preventive measures designated in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions referred to in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is , however , not possible or desirable from residues , so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ rede@@ em@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire amount of material freed on the basis of this Article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
( III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of accumulation ;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures according to this agreement , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures to that material .
the Community meets with the Organization Supp@@ le@@ mentary Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , which is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in the individual as to apply the procedures set out in the Convention .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed without any amend@@ ment of this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organisation , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the Organization shall establish a summari@@ zed inventory of the underlying nuclear material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its scrut@@ iny .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other
in the weighing of the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) E@@ EC decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ ce@@ ran@@ s@@ ference problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is tied up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle link@@ ages to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement .
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Dis@@ pos@@ al Account &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States are contributing to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to by the Organization as Administrator ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; Administrator ) , &quot; only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the Member State , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the State at the order of the organization as custo@@ dian of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organisation &apos;s deposit in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator @-@ appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
the bai@@ li@@ ff particip@@ ates in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the Notes , in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral advance ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered for the financing of the organization financed by ordinary funds of the organization , whereby the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement must be taken into account .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or by the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally valid for the organization &apos;s loans ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 10 free years each in 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts to the payment of these data are to be paid directly to the organization that retains them .
each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced ( i ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan at the time the loan was granted .
capital re@@ payments from special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
the bai@@ li@@ ff will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors to complete all the special transaction loans issued by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the re@@ payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator will receive the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this .
the Administrator con@@ veys the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed accounting of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are payable from the account recei@@ v@@ ables , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators through to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transaction fees and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this Agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may possibly agree upon , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the entire capital amount of all special transaction loans taken in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are not@@ ing the Council of the Council of the European Communities concerning the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement will become effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 on the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program comprises the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a common company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Shared Group JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work is carried out until the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is carried out , it is in the interest of the contractual partners of the present agreement to combine their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to expe@@ dite their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable any contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and consequently achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties involved associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it will be extended or altered under review by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom Programme .
each time the parties accept a new programme , this shall be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association envis@@ aged in Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the parties to the contract during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- The exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , called &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom Programme ;

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobil@@ isation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit an application .
the agreement could be concluded until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units , equivalent to 50 % of the member countries &apos; future delivery funds .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions being made without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded .
in the opening of the loans , as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the initial draw will not be made before the exp@@ iry of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement at the disposal of the available currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with taking into account the resources of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the time of business under similar conditions , that is , interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised by the Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit an application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am pleased to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other parties only under the condition that there is no profit associated with it , that they are only used for medical purposes and that they are supplied only to places designated by the governments involved .
each consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to the blood group determination must be accompanied by a certificate that they were made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its installation constitute an administrative Agreement that may be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the Parties to this Convention .
the parties to the contract meet all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided by other parties to the blood group determination of all input data .
they also take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances meet the recipients described in Article 3 quickly and in the shortest possible way .
the parties to the parties submit a list of positions to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , which are authorised to exhibit the certificate envis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical to places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the replacement of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe to sign up ; they can become a contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ; or
this Convention shall enter into force one month after the day , when three of the Council members have signed it according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or have rati@@ fied or approved it .
any member who signs or rati@@ fies or appro@@ ves this Agreement later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval shall enter into force one month after signing or submitting the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
through ever @-@ renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analyzed , the ti@@ ter is measured to the double in an appropriate medium .
the ti@@ tre is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the most powerful serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other agents , which are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ Drug as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of International units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ s is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cker , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ tre indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of an unknown agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain up to 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative study of the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents based on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether they are in fluid form or after replacement , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group analysis .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents are to be stored away from the laboratory for a long time , until it can be assumed that the bat@@ ches are no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group analysis may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , while others are the necessary aid to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container a black on white printed label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing liquid ,
in addition , this label or the label on the box where the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing liquid ,

some &quot; incomplete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on slides as well as hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are absorbed in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the efficacy of serum for the determination of the r@@ h group may possibly be changed when International Standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .

a &quot; incomplete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding equivalent in comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .

it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 in relation to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .

in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce the costs incurred by the fact that goods in international trade are re@@ marked and re @-@ coded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of trade documents and the transmission of data ,
in the weighing that the development of the technique and structures of international trade necess@@ itated significant changes to the Brussels agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods into the customs tari@@ ffs ,

taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the Cooperation in the Custom@@ s Services Committee on the Harmon@@ ised System in this area ,

protocol on the 1979 Convention on Dec@@ lar@@ ed Air Dec@@ isions concerning the Com@@ b@@ asing of emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or of its gr@@ en@@ ox@@ ing flow
concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ contamination substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural values of vital importance for the environment and economy ,
mind@@ ful of the fact that the executive body has recognised the need for the Convention on its second meeting to effectively reduce the annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and movable sources or their gr@@ en@@ genic flow to 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , maintain and inspect their emission limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
taking into account existing scientific and technical data about emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their subsequent products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to take effective measures to fight and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ y stream , in particular by applying suitable national emissions limits for new moving larger local sources and by retro@@ fitting existing sources of local sources ,
in the realisation that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions further develops and that this development is to be taken into account in the examination of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures ,
