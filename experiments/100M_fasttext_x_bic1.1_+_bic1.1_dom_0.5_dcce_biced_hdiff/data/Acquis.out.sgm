<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the review procedure to the phases of the fuel cycle, which could be produced, processing, use and storage of nuclear material, which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core brittle bodies, and the greatest possible restriction of the review procedure for other core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) For effective implementation of the securing measures according to this Convention, the Community of the Organization accords information on core material, which is subject to security measures, and about the characteristics of the facilities required to carry out the securing measures relating to this material from Belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data, which is compatible with the implementation of its duties under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on investments shall be limited to the minimum dimension required for the use of security measures in relation to core material, which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) In search of the community, the organisation is prepared to check investment data which considers the community to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially overmediated by the organization, provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organization fetches the consent of the Community and States to the naming of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) If the Community raises objection either against the proposed naming or at any time against an appointed designation, the organisation of the Community and States proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) If, on the basis of the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to appoint inspectors of the Organization, who are hindered by this Convention, the Council will be refusing to address the following as "the Director General," with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually fulfill the tasks underlying them according to their Convention.</seg>
<seg id="657">(C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the Organization are arranged in such a way that i) are as low as possible the possible harassment and disturbance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspectors of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the Organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as its inspectors and other officials carrying out tasks under this Convention, the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on Privileges and Liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="660">The security measures according to this Convention are terminated with regard to core material, if the community and the organization state that the material is consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of the security measures of Belang, or has practically not become recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this Convention, the Community notifies the transfer of core material from the states that underlies safeguards according to this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="662">The safeguards according to this Convention shall be terminated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state, as envisaged in this Convention, has assumed responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id="663">The organization conducts documents, from which any transfer and, if necessary, the reapplication of the securing measures to the given core material.</seg>
<seg id="664">Should the core material, which is subject to preventive measures under this agreement, be used in non-nuclear activities, such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics, the association agrees with the organisation of such use of the material, under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material.</seg>
<seg id="665">II) that the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives during the non-application of the preventive measures in accordance with this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="666">(B) The organization and the community make a provision in such a way that the preventive measures envisaged in this Convention shall not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity.</seg>
<seg id="667">As far as possible, the provision will determine how long and under what circumstances these security measures will not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any case, the preventive measures envisaged in this Convention will be applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organization is held on the current level by the total quantity and composition of this material in the State or the State concerned, and any passing on of such material from this state or states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their consent as quickly as possible; it extends only on matters such as temporal and procedural rules and agreements for reporting, but does not include a approval or a knowledge of the military activity that is under secret protection and does not refer to the unsuccessful use of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the Community, States or persons subject to their sovereign authority, however, extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization, the organization will reimburse these costs, provided that they have clarified beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="673">The organization carries in any case the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages, including insurance or other financial security, may be applied to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim that the community or the state against the organization or the organization vis-à-vis the Community or any state due to damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - which resulted from the implementation of the security measures according to the Convention, is governed in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="676">If the Council, after examining the relevant information presented by the Director-General, states that the organization is not able to verify that no core material, which is subject to preventive measures for nuclear weapons or other core brittings, can reimburse the reports provided in Article XII (C) of the Statutes and, if applicable, also take the other measures provided there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council, in which mass was attained by the measures applied to security measures, takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security.</seg>
<seg id="678">On request of the Organization, Community or State, consultations on questions arise from the interpretation or application of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I regarding securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the preventive measures defined in this agreement is to detect significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence of such degradation by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">For the substitution of the target set in Article 28, the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, fading with the spatial inclusion and observation as important supplemental measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the test carried out by the organization is made by an explanation, in which the quantity of material not shown for a specific period of time is specified by specifying the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out its scrutiny, the organisation pursues after Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown of material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the Community of de procedures and measures shall make use of the following kind and, as far as necessary, envisage as it is intended to be further determined and conducive to the supplemental agreements:</seg>

<seg id="706">F) a protocol and reporting system, which exhibits the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance area for each material balance zone, including the one and outputs of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">G) precautions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Procedure to reimburse reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The security measures according to this Convention shall not extend to material in the mining industry or in the ore treatment.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) uranium or thoriumcontaining material, which has not yet reached the entered phase of the nuclear cycle circuit, is introduced into the States, so the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not established for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or isotopane enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is made, or will be introduced into the States in a later phase of the core material cycle, so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The preventive measures designated in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions referred to in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the Community is, however, not possible or desirable from residues, so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non-redeemable.</seg>
<seg id="714">At the request of the Community, the organization frees the following core material from the safeguards according to this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material when used in non-nuclear activities according to Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is more than 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the Community, the organization frees core material, which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this agreement, from these safeguards, provided that the entire amount of material freed on the basis of this Article in the States is at no time more than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>

<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the Organization shall establish a summarized inventory of the underlying nuclear material in the states, regardless of its origin, and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organization) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">In the weighing of the GRÜNDE - a) EEC decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hindered by general ressourceransference problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is tied up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle linkages to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Disposal Account" which consists of the funds which the Member States are contributing to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to by the Organization as Administrator (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "Administrator)," only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the Member State, which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the State at the order of the organization as custodian of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organisation's deposit in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrator-appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may, upon request, make payments to the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">The bailiff participates in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization about proportionate drawing on the cash or the Notes, in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including a sectoral advance), irrespective of whether it is part of the organization's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices which are considered for the financing of the organization financed by ordinary funds of the organization, whereby the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or by the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally valid for the organization's loans; they are therefore refundable in 10 free years each in 50 years.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to the payment of these data are to be paid directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced (i) in a member state; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan at the time the loan was granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The bailiff will instruct the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors to complete all the special transaction loans issued by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the repayment of the special transaction loan, the administrator will receive the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses incurred for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator conveys the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed accounting of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are payable from the account receivables, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrators through to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programs or projects financed by special transaction fees and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this Agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organization may possibly agree upon, the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting therefrom shall be due immediately.</seg>
