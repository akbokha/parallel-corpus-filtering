this document is a summary of the European Public Health Authority Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or how to treat it , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Whe@@ ther thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients have cycli@@ c episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ setting ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to insert or treat the tabl@@ es@@ po@@ ds in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are just as degra@@ ded as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be modified by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow nerve cells to communicate among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole seems most likely to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised using Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the fusion tablets and the solution to absorb them .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reducing symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo .
in applying the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , up to 74 weeks later , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recovery of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered to an existing treatment .
as placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for recording ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include extra py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sy , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who primarily had man@@ ic episodes and were out@@ weighed by the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displaying mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes refer to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be cau@@ ti@@ ously used in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events involving patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally administered drugs with overl@@ apping effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other potent inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made .
for C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar doses should be taken .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the accompanying therapy begins .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in the concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation in humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal studies on the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from o@@ dom@@ ici@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intended or un@@ inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ A , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary school goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mono@@ therapies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that sometimes did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole indicated a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ loc@@ ating of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences concerning eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they only have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which were found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , were not found to be more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mid @-@ c@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a significant reduction of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mid @-@ c@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
the Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ id muscle or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ pose regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be administered depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melt @-@ coated tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were caused differently from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be cau@@ ti@@ ously used in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and abnormal heart rhythms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects were used to use Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) as a single dose intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar doses should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the accompanying therapy begins .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 U@@ sed side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvement of ast@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 hours ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ amine reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in the analysis of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ tig@@ mati@@ sm , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary school goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole indicated a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger after intra@@ muscular injection in the first 2 hours after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no immediate toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there were no safety @-@ related concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 @-@ and 11 @-@ fold of the central steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in terms of the efficacy indicators , such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival , only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer found no difference between the medicines .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be prescribed with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensor@@ less neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of c@@ anned adap@@ tations in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use with children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could essentially have other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients there should be no repeated treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ emer@@ gen@@ ics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) which can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects , which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the adverse events associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , tooth@@ ache , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ eness in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , back pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , f@@ lange pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequently :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umen receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the tumour area due to the alb@@ um@@ bing protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two un@@ armed un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of an in@@ fusion .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center trial was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
when recording in the study 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra @-@ vascular distribution and / or direction binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane application ( 43 % ) compared to a solution containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a of the untreated drug was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ances .
however , only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , precau@@ tions should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market prior to the market launch provided medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal ha@@ em@@ o@@ lic acid which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications if a blood donation is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with De@@ par@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make their own blood donation Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
amed into a vein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before either par@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of bli@@ stre@@ amed under the skin stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who have been converted to se@@ amed have been maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages to the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without an iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .

the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 to 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ as may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should attempt to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the long ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should attempt to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rel@@ o@@ glob@@ in number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline value , the dose should be kept 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the optic disc number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times per week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the bas@@ eline value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anning is required , should receive dor@@ z@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the tra@@ pf@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg of 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients suffering from an@@ thro@@ po@@ bla@@ stom@@ a in a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian well @-@ known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently onset heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need of trans@@ fu@@ sions , the lab@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated .
if the lab@@ u@@ loid value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weighed to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ u@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically proven coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to the latest findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response should be taken into account in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a hi@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be modified according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 for Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic operation , if possible , before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis because they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the case of underlying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded that an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can be associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , when ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots were reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it may occur in patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ extracted epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels obtained after IV injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

the owner of the licensing agreement must ensure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 1. of the application is functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the transport .
the owner of the license agreement comm@@ its to the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the risk management plan accepted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use &quot; with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • For the receipt of new information , the impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures could have been mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by request by the E@@ MEA
• In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • the risk of a blood cl@@ ump in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) , for example , has occurred in the past such a blood c@@ lot

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ forms during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and before the start of treatment with De@@ par@@ amed .
after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported very rarely about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ata after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best to treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , De@@ par@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting in a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium concentrations , your doctor may take into consideration an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a specific value .
according to the latest findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with ab@@ u@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose appropriately to keep the risk of blood c@@ cul@@ turing ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully balanced against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred in the past ( e.g. deep vein rom@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances it can neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if you undergo a major orthop@@ edic surgery , it is recommended to check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment and treat it accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ u@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ amp@@ y after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines or have been used recently / used , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value .
once you are well set , you receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equal big inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of a patient ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2@@ 127 male and female oste@@ opor@@ osis women over the age of 50 who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study of elderly women , the risk of spine frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fusion .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta offers clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit to transport Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • The package insert • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long run@@ time period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , appropriately twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the use of ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 since data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia prior to treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta can be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid introduction of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient calcium intake , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental implants , there is no data available to reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and be based on an individual benefit / risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the use of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of pre@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a serious adverse event was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis for over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of the application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta over 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease @-@ treated Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was commonly reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental sur@@ geri@@ es .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ dog ≤ -@@ 2.5 and with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures of ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all points of time ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh weight by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic crest a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial score up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial score up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial score up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total capacity was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment showed the BM@@ D at all points of time .
compared to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D compared to placebo and 4.3 % on the lower arm .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in response to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold the normal @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day for 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response to 141 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared with 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
sudden bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large circulation cycle with half @-@ life t ½ x 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages ( α and β , with the ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned t ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the cell acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a decreased clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because it is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to humans and because they are weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ changing inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ances of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance down to 35@@ ml / min does not require the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice adjustment .
because there is only limited data available for severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ sequ@@ ential intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and a weight of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in mice .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application the ren@@ al tolerance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered by doses ranging from 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg , administered at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that had sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent finding in repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for drug use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been achieved .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction in order to ensure normal bone formation , thereby adding strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have been used recently / used , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are concerned that , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please consult your nearest doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at the moment , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received ac@@ la@@ sta .

allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is especially important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid introduction of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atically conc@@ entri@@ c , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , and the maximum is usually occurring within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , in accordance with at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

it is an addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and juven@@ iles under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or changes of mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Authority Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and / or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took in addition placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ dies@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that in the context of mon@@ otherapy , Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission granted approval to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited in October 2000 for Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and bear the inscription &quot; 15 &quot; on one side and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one for patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been assessed by clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
the result of increased insulin sensitivity is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients receiving pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy .
after the introduction of Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , a worsen@@ ing of visual acuity was reported in diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one
the calculated incidence of frac@@ tures was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment should be dep@@ uted ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ sensitivity of the mother animal resulting from pregnancy and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the cur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were more often compared to placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .
since the market introduction has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , more frequently however when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medicine was conducted .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) were treated in patients treated with comparative medicine .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one appears to be activated by activating specific nucle@@ i recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by specific nucle@@ i recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of the therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequately set with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimi@@ zing phase were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the bas@@ eline compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and a slightly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol level were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced total plasma matri@@ ces and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found in pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide showed reduced values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ convenience tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both about an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups receiving either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been proven that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance resemble the mother substance .
toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ sensitivity of the mother animal resulting in the gest@@ ation and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary tract was induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ one .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and bear the inscription &quot; 30 &quot; on one side and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated incidence of frac@@ tures was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the bas@@ eline compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ convenience tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both about an effect on tr@@ yp@@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ als , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and the rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparison medi@@ cation showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ kes indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ectable needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy can be used to change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia alert symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change with regard to starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can lead to a change in dosage .
in case of change to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient a dosage adjustment is required , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in an in@@ sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with transi@@ ent or permanent disrup@@ tions of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Fun@@ eral - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort associated as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .
5 Inten@@ si@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin and skin tissue diseases - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point can arise a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the pun@@ cture points inside the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the administration of the inj@@ ections Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .
disorders of the immune system Community - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions Symp@@ toms of gener@@ alized over@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / loss of consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ proven help person or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the overall duration is up to 24 hours .
absorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) loc@@ alities on the human @-@ insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane water bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before being res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for the first use .

this document is a summary of the European Public Health Authority Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
an effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the process of re@@ combin@@ ant technology :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged ?
ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that is quickly acting must first be drawn up , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 In case of change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration of the inj@@ ections Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ proven help person or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing larger surgical procedures has shown that the mortality decreased by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) due to intraven@@ ous @-@ given ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the overall duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

11 In case of change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients receive further medicines for the prevention of g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once daily , received an ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with cardiac complaints in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present g@@ out and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and youths because there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other herbal medicines , a acute depression may occur during the course of treatment , because first ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed through the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acidity level .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ist did not have interactions with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( a hibition of metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dosage adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , delayed the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be assured that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiac events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis compared to the allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and occurs as part of the reaction sc@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in whom the last three month specified serum levels of serum decreased &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 0.2 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the regular dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction in serum @-@ acid sa@@ c acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels of serum &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl receive 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d . h .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C reached the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum di@@ re @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ set of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ m E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ aci@@ al acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the commen@@ cement of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in two years of the open renewal study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out deaths so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the number of g@@ no@@ des , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the top grades by month 24 .
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were dose @-@ proportion@@ ately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportion@@ ate increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum di@@ re @-@ acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

the plasma protein binding from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ ting the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not to be relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in whom the last three month specified serum levels of serum decreased &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data gathered in two years of the open renewal study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out deaths so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a g@@ out ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first meal of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than for those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also provided data showing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , recorded abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic up@@ positions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it must not be used in disorders of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. company a licence for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• On the day of the day AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , should be given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , o@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in the event of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn .
3 . the risk of severe G@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate there was no increased risk , rarely ( after market introduction ) Magen@@ to and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contain predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a s@@ late surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when they fail to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in relation to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported .
nevertheless , taken from the serum cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Be@@ aked to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability declined accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Cir@@ cul@@ ation studies have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly re@@ distri@@ butes to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance selected within 72 hours was ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other pharmaceuticals through these transport systems .
resor@@ ption in healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE following noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before intake of a meal the mean surface below the Ser@@ um concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng / h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an period up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ated in the liver and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form in the kidney .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects the average elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is rapidly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there is no clinical data available , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly higher al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate accumulation in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation where the use of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined , like Adv@@ agra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .
tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ant@@ f , as the dosage or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ s@@ ular part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; W@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; the formulation of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure measured as a valley level was comparable to both levels of both kidney and liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ ant@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct night transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose scheme can take several days to reach the steady state .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral consumption of medicines in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be induced by intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f Do a recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules be converted to a once daily dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this change has to be done in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ant@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must commen@@ ce once a day .
in the case of adult patients undergoing Adv@@ ant@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , received pro@@ gra@@ f in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintenance of blood tests in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose may be necessary .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of cre@@ atine in@@ contin@@ ence and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a topical C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c checks .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that might change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may take several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the lowering levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may result in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus deficiency or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; the formulation of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is no clinical data available for the ret@@ ardi@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
there is still no clinical data available for the ret@@ ardi@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in childhood .
due to possible interactions leading to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ f , is to be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a chamber or sep@@ tum treated as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy could be observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
in patients with a rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption , adv@@ ant hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose are provided with special caution .
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering simultaneous supple@@ mentation of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentration ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ Tech antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs called tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase hormone exposure , precau@@ tionary measures should be taken particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously in decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is a risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often in@@ accurate due to the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the adverse events are reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) .

cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - and lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ sis .
on the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice a day after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplantation .
175 treatment transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3,@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( WHO , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of chronic bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation which received a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and gut and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) , the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f showed an updated rate of survival of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile .
in stable patients prescribed by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ant@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .

advice is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
dosage and frequency of use depend on whether adv@@ ant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but manufactured according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
lawyer is another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions was examined .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ at@@ as in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ at@@ ants ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
lawyer should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ defect , on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
during the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be taken .
the dosage speed should be directed at the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always indic@@ ative of the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directional Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , following conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ ghtness ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s appearing in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of whom have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the expected decrease of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate revealed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .

furthermore , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) had been identified as a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tr@@ es against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend and a persi@@ sting peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , isolated cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .

all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters originate from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to assess the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for licensing Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures within the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer occurred in the sub@@ structure , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP produces a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compound @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the severity of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , patients under Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who alone received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart chase ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ om@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , which are other drugs called nor@@ adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ tra @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , urine retention ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit to transport Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , crush@@ ing or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , we should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment may be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which are per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as a declining rhin@@ ologic medicine ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data will not suff@@ ice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with liver or liver dysfunction , and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treating hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or intensi@@ fication of the headache ) must be dis@@ continued .
patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before the testing of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the safety of the use of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ oric properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ om@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ els .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurements of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered .
after the per@@ or@@ tal application of aer@@ om@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after the use of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not identify any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and of rab@@ bits was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash have been reported .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart chase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , sei@@ z@@ ure , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspic@@ uous h@@ ep@@ atic cancer were also very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ml of ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight trials involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials for seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ g@@ gans , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the scores of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease in the scores after six weeks treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
am@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been completed and resum@@ ed .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases there may be di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse event was headaches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were given .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses given to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over a period of ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurements of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified as an alternative to the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the e@@ ti@@ ology is similar in the different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance strain ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose I@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be extra@@ pol@@ ated by adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with the psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a ampli@@ fication of the alcohol @-@ induced impairment of the performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergies .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation following a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ ung@@ bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene closing lid with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le must be taken for taking in without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G @-@ interval data .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurements of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adults .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ tabl@@ ette proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population .
form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ char@@ ase is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were more common than placebo , diar@@ rhea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company accepts its proposal to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) .
after the ino@@ cul@@ ation of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus that is contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ foreign , &quot; and trains antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as a body alien ) has been st@@ oned off and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are attending a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over the age of four , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral medicinal drugs the patient has previously taken and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ gen@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV levels in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
aids do not cure AIDS , but can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with in@@ significant concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , the viral load also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children , previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were limited to treatment .
in the study of adults treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , under a@@ gen@@ ase , there was a stronger descent of the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal preparation for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as degra@@ ded as am@@ er@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , patients who take ap@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines out@@ weigh the risks of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years in comparison with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic converter Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of am@@ re@@ ase in combination with k@@ night avi@@ r in patients who previously did not occupy a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally supposed to be under exceptional circumstances , as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of k@@ night avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ ic@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ nights or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chro@@ med P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ est@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a con@@ current administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for breath withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ sis of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of 4 and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
regeneration should be reduced to 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ a@@ zer@@ b@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus were reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ oma occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chro@@ med P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ ah virus and , if possible , examine the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x , is increased by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of am@@ ox@@ in in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but because of the sac@@ ra@@ mental component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ap@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may decrease the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is required for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ap@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69 times compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneously using F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with ap@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not be taken at the same time as am@@ re@@ ase as it can result in resor@@ ption dys@@ functions .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
con@@ currently taking A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s simultaneous administration with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ est@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level are expected with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
thus , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for breath withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be modified with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related substances ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passing into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , given by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to a drop in treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( bull jaw@@ s ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull jaw@@ s ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were treated under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without requiring treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received a@@ gen@@ ase along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ protein prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of an education of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other k@@ nights avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure of more than 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically validated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally maintained .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all four F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which an anti@@ retro@@ viral medication failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have adverse effects on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which treated with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side analo@@ gues ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly performed with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on avi@@ r in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ aching threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ controlled aspir@@ in is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of whom 152 was treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; am@@ per@@ ase should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI treated children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % has been increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was therefore un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows large distribution volumes and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream to the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit / inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are simultaneously given with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those employed in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were found in male animals that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - x ( rat ) of the exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanisms for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas have not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ gen@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ju@@ g@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed in a systemic plasma exposure , significantly lower than ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of k@@ night avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
regeneration should be reduced to 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x , is increased by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , even though there is no clinical data available .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a 22 % reduction of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the n@@ ett@@ le in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; am@@ per@@ ase should be taken into account during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit / inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are simultaneously given with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were found in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 x ( rat ) of the human exposure after a twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of k@@ night avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not documented either with PI pre @-@ treated patients or with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of an A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ sis , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with ren@@ al failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
regeneration should be set in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug - 49 depen@@ ded factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ oma occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x , is increased by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ currently taking with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is unknown . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related substances ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passing into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , given by the entr@@ ench@@ ment in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other k@@ nights avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have adverse effects on subsequent treatment .
62 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; am@@ per@@ ase should be taken into account during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to the tissue by a large volume of c@@ ous@@ ins and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ oses it is recommended to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered onto the affected areas of the skin , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials in which patients were treated for six weeks and received al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies included bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immun@@ ological adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ canal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the course of treatment described above should be considered if intense local inflammation occurs ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed in the cleared , infected skin area until the cream is completely covered .
there should be an assessment in these patients between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients there should be a balance between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ i@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a recur@@ rent stri@@ k@@ tur .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been found to apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous procedures applied to the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ canal areas .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of cow@@ l reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the eradic@@ ation of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions atro@@ phy after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or because of the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment interval can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data available about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ step .
only very limited data are available about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after dis@@ continuing treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fo@@ etal development , fet@@ ching or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) cannot be quanti@@ fied by a single or repeated top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be applied during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most reported and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
adverse events reported from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream reported side effects below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects of 25@@ 2 placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this placebo @-@ controlled review of the clinical signs shows that placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread often lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / abor@@ ting / scra@@ pping ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the assessment of the clinical signs indicated according to the protocol indicates that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe shor@@ tening and c@@ anning ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent single oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentration of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines has been demonstrated after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy was significantly superior to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated the genital war@@ ts completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five times of application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ elle bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data available from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured , and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week ) for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentration of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the point of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to be considered very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the non @-@ active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ covering devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring magnitude of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and where necessary to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transport al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in individual steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any adverse side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the phase 3 clinical trial , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the in@@ fusion begins with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be re@@ absorbed by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table for the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation stand and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desired drug interactions with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe form of follow @-@ up and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a serum conversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up in patients at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . up to premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients did not present an antibody being det@@ ectable by radio@@ immuno@@ stain@@ ing ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients in whom there was never a serum conversion .
patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ des .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken from cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were of the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the difficult phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ Min@@ utes .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function and mobility compared to the placebo group , which is shown in the following table .
the open renewal study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study showed normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point ( expected Per@@ cent@@ age normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walking , motion area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year open Phase 2 trial investigating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form of follow @-@ up and 4 with middle form ) .
in four patients , the dose increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a growth growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow @-@ up showed normal mental development speed , whereas older patients with severe form were only limited or not progres@@ sing in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medications against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spreads very easily to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive vitamin B@@ 12 inj@@ ections .
if as@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ medication &quot; ( anti @-@ vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( in order to prevent a fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or if certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed or reduced or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the medi@@ an survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared with doc@@ et@@ axel compared to 7.@@ 9 months .
however , in both studies , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to permit the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift as well as the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed a minimum of 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid have to be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood mur@@ al or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
following the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient reaches the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if there is a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older , there is an increased side effect risk compared to patients at the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dosage adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin level and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ level immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ ten@@ te has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ again .
dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ at@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were treated when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ lu@@ cellular space a drainage of the ergometer before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this agent was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible impairment of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to treatment advice to obtain advice on the conservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible deterioration of the reproductive capacity is indicated by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the start of treatment to obtain advice on the locking of sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed random@@ ized , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) in phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with study medicine ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in hospital studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment , occasionally cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy were reported in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of an over @-@ medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only covered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) associated with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was demonstrated in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted from an improvement in the pulmon@@ ary function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of the lung function during the time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC followed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately controlled , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment is similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
middle PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = equ@@ est@@ rian @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = scale of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total deposit interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non@@ compliance limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ sions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total population of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study of Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs who received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ ti@@ cular changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fi@@ cal epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless un@@ processed , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should usually not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has occurred under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
solve the content of 100 mg cup bottles with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who are taking All@@ i and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving the All@@ i 60 mg group had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , pull ld@@ r , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , drop @-@ off secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term Mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or at ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K on the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 as there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dose of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in normal range remained .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time ob@@ serves a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to any symptoms or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical results .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects resulting from the assimil@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect consists in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rem@@ nant of the ga@@ str@@ ic and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lip@@ ases .
from clinical studies , it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , blocking the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in L@@ DL cholesterol in or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral presentation of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general therapeutic doses of not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ tonic ring ) and M3 ( M1 after fis@@ sion of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) were identified in a study of obes@@ e patients presenting approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not identify any particular danger to humans .

with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutrition @-@ related con@@ com@@ it@@ ants : • Beg@@ inning already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C. • Store closed tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ licate , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this pack .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • Stro@@ ke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive effect on your health .
select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to feed permanently heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most a day .
observe the tables below in this paragraph . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the information that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related con@@ com@@ it@@ ant phenomena . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ oric intake should enable you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week of weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you only do little or no steps daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities .
• For sustained weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • F@@ ully is a nutritional diary containing data on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calorie and fat du@@ cks and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate cause of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of al@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti @-@ medication ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate cause of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong causes of nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ pos ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ e in the European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , alo@@ xi is not used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not tumor the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences of using pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least related to alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results from the studies of moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses ranging from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days comparable to a single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the single dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body office was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ances 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose equivalent to 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because al@@ xi is used in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report that recommended the use of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon showed data that shows the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is ...
in addition , concerns have been expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ar@@ ded more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently validated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected layers ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used to treat infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
during the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar responses : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin dogs , about 90 % of both groups of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the surface of the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small ret@@ inas , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn ul@@ cers .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a licence for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment must be di@@ lig@@ ently wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection commen@@ ced .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area after 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment increased to decreased skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fo@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical studies involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that used al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the administration was about 1 % of the patients concerned .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ac@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site contains ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding to this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding sites and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear at least some infection forms due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ af@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us treatment , the presence of stems with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on scra@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ Med@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism in human liver micro@@ som@@ en in vitro was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with the low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid gland changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats @-@ micro@@ nucle@@ us test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus achieving a maximum exposure of 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been established .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan , consisting of two doses , can be put to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved since 1996 , and the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children , which has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given children as part of a vacc@@ ination consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix included adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 % and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children led to the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B after the last inj@@ ections .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a 6 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain in the injection point , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals S.@@ a. a licence for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the vacc@@ ination plan for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a screening chim@@ e is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mono@@ cy@@ tic vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully guaranteed whether immuno@@ competent individuals who responded to a hepatitis vacc@@ ination will need a screening chim@@ e as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the use of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from immune system disorders , insufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may be reached , so that additional doses may be needed in these cases .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could result in a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ec@@ cable success , these injection methods should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , the atmosphere can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ously , as in these cases , bleeding can occur after intra@@ muscular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier Thi@@ omer and preserv@@ ative @-@ based vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 ino@@ cul@@ ations were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine doses at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the combination of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % for the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received the Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent x group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
statisti@@ cally , the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies , which were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , after the completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ mers , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was similar to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the vaccine of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ories and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions , similar to the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art char@@ ge release is carried out by a state laboratory or laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ us@@ ory food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by waste water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccine doses , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination point ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has been shown to you / your child .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix becomes people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take / take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child had recently been vacc@@ inated or received immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is imperative that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) if you have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
very common ( more than 1 fall per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the inc@@ ision site or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite
bite frequently ( up to 1 fall per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 vacc@@ inated cans ) are :
these include limited or extended sur@@ charges that can be it@@ chy or blo@@ ated , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like symptoms including ch@@ ills , muscular and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ percep@@ tions such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mobility of some parts of the body , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , dis@@ ruption of normal brain functions
impotence inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels un@@ happiness or disease , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and stomach pain change the liver function tests lymph@@ atic jun@@ c@@ tive swelling to ble@@ ed@@ ings or to bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ising ) caused by the decrease of the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ et .
notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you / your child significantly or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this packing supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ completely enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dic content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information was given to this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in the ne@@ on@@ atal age ( within the first 28 days of living ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete cell defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ eth@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ im@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with care in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain also found a decrease in brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dium top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death even when treated with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
through ha@@ em@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and eventually sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ im@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
in the majority of patients with cycli@@ c disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medicine is secre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate did not have any un@@ cla@@ im@@ ant effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who are not able to swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal dy@@ e or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ eth@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ im@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dium top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the toxic waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if your lab tests are carried out , tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , delayed hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were also observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood mur@@ al ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , uncomfortable skin odor , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain , and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box and the container after &quot; User to &quot; stated exp@@ iry date .

angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stop up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ography or EC@@ G ) .
if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was frequently employed ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) .
in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non - ST mid@@ wife attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous 0.1 mg / kg of an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if subsequently a PCI is performed in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately prior to the procedure a bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of Angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous tightening of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the in@@ ox dose is rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ um against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again .
in patients with severe kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the submission of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us with an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with Angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Seri@@ ous hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ots . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in patients suffering from arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) can , in principle , perform bleeding throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine returns the existing level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , these substances will increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination with bi@@ vali@@ um with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters in each case are regularly controlled .
animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , the development of embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ um group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding , as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood spot , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study involving a bi@@ vali@@ um in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI therapy .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in the event of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ um is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ um , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ing inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din on th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine with serum from patients with par@@ affin @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect supported by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the case of a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ um should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different to acting insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting Hum@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes in which insulin cannot function effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism mean that insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of action strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may change the insulin demand .
3 A inadequate dosage or interruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be subject to strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the type of action of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment plan .
the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , symp@@ athetic oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din , and reserves may be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation .
animal studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ ism enters into human breast milk , but generally insulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk nor is resor@@ bed to oral health .
listed below are the un@@ desired treatments known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and classified by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dispens@@ ing of glucose by a doctor .
following a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ination , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ ism in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect , just like Hum@@ acting .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect about 2 hours earlier than Hum@@ insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as given with normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin l@@ ul@@ is was put in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was achieved than with normal insulin insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as human normal insulin , which is given 2 mic@@ ros@@ aries before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal started compared to normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to normal insulin insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
