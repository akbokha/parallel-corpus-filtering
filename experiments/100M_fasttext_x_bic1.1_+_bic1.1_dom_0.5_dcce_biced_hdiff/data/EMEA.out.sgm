<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Authority Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or how to treat it, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Whether thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental disorder where patients have cyclic episodes (periods of abnormal upsetting) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased anxiety or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to insert or treat the tablespods in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are just as degraded as Abilify, the dose should be modified by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow nerve cells to communicate among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole seems most likely to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilised using Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the fusion tablets and the solution to absorb them.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reducing symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying the bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, up to 74 weeks later, Abilify prevented the recovery of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">As placebo, Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for recording (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include extra pyramidal disturbances (drowsiness), nausea, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), drowsy, nausea, drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who primarily had manic episodes and were outweighed by the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients displaying mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes refer to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menopause of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be cautiously used in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">For this reason, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events involving patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyhagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally administered drugs with overlapping effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and similar doses should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the accompanying therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in the concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation in humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal studies on the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a total reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients suffering from odomiciin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintended or unintentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HTA, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">When using Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, nucleus caudatus and the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of respondents adhered to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary school goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a significant reduction of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features that sometimes did not refer to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole indicated a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was considering the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylocating of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in poor 'poor' Metabolisians above CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects at Aripiprazole, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences concerning ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they only have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, concentrations of the Sulphate Conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole, which were found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, were not found to be more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Gall of Monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which resulted in expositions of the 3- and 11x of the mid-cady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically attached, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazole injection solution and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the deltoid muscle or deep in the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of adipose regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be administered depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melt-coated tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with astringent and behavioural disorders that were caused differently from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be cautiously used in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and abnormal heart rhythms).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyhagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects were used to use Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) as a single dose intramuscularly and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' ('poor') Metabolisians the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteaseininhibitors, may have similar effects and similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the accompanying therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that after the sole gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials involving Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="163">The incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 Used side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant improvement of astoxicity / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 hours) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as astringent and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the astringent and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepamine reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In the analysis of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe astigmatism, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of respondents adhered to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary school goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Depressions scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not refer to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole indicated a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was considering the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger after intramuscular injection in the first 2 hours after receiving the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injection was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no immediate toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there were no safety-related concerns following maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbit) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, some of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane treated the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">In terms of the efficacy indicators, such as time to worsening disease and survival, only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer found no difference between the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be prescribed with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease is failing and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>

<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation, as the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequently) which can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects, which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the adverse events associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100); common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, toothache, loose stool, oesophagitis, soreness in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, back pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flange pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal relationship with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules substance that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumen receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation appears in the tumour area due to the albumbing protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unarmed unaffiliated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was administered over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of an infusion.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter trial was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">When recording in the study 64% of patients had impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound of baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extra-vascular distribution and / or direction binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane application (43%) compared to a solution containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-diihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urea of the untreated drug was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearances.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal haemolic acid which may occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications if a blood donation is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Deparamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make their own blood donation Abseamed is to be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by anthropoietine deficiency or by not responding adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Amed into a vein as part of a major study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, Abseamed was compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before either paramed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of blistreamed under the skin streamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who have been converted to seamed have been maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which manufactures Abseamed, will provide information packages to the medical staff in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma that receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia when chemotherapy begins).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l, no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large electro-orthopaedic surgery in adults without an iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 to 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with haemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and follicas may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the doctor's assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should attempt to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value rises by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the long haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the doctor's assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should attempt to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reloglobin number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline value, the dose should be kept 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the optic disc number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have increased compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) three times per week after another 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be kept three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retiulozytente increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the baseline value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canning is required, should receive dorzamed at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible, e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the trapfamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg of 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the tube of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from anthropoblastoma in a erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnesian well-known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with severe elective orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently onset heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effectiveness, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need of transfusions, the labulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxicity, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the labuloid value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocyte "Index"), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be weighed to the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abuamed in patients with a risk of an antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically proven coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the latest findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet to be dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin-response should be taken into account in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hib value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be modified according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 for Patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a greater elective orthopaedic operation, if possible, before the onset of epoetin-alfa treatment, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate prophylactic prophylaxis because they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can be associated with epoetin alfa for patients with an output haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, when haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysms, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots were reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or worsening an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, it may occur in patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteoarthritis (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta offers clarification material for doctors who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information about how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted Novartis Europharm Limited a permit to transport Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages: • The package insert • Concontraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg Aclasta infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment by the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long runtime period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, appropriately twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen, shortly after the use of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 since data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia prior to treatment with aclasta can be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid introduction of the effect of citric acid on bone structure, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, the maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient calcium intake, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice daily, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental implants, there is no data available to reduce the risk of osteoecrosis in the jaw area with bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and be based on an individual benefit / risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after Aclasta may be reduced by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen after the use of aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of prefibrillation reported as a serious adverse event was increased (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinin clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis for over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of the application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta over 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of the patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the disease-treated Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administration of citric acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoecrosis in the jaw area was commonly reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw area) which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extractions or other dental surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be obtained by adding oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkeldog ≤ -2.5 and with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric fluid fractures of aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all points of time (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the thigh weight by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvic crest a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial score up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial score up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial score up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not measured routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total capacity was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment showed the BMD at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to a 5.4% increase in BMD compared to placebo and 4.3% on the lower arm.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially mild to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in response to 2.6x to 3,0fold the normal-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of coledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedron once a day for 2 months was detected in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responses at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated with risedronate, the therapeutic response to 141 patients treated with Aclasta compared with 71 patients treated with risedronate could be maintained during an average follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rose rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Sudden biphasic disappearing from the large circulation cycle with half-life t ½ x 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages (α and β, with the abovementioned t ½ -values) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the cell acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because it is not metabolized to humans and because they are weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-changing inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearances of the coledron acid correlated with the creatinin clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function down to a creatine Clearance down to 35ml / min does not require the coledron juice adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there is only limited data available for severe kidney function (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-sequential intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and a weight of 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in mice.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with IV application the renal tolerance of Zoledron acid in rats was administered by doses ranging from 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion of 0.25 mg / kg, administered at intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated exposures that had sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent finding in repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a result that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats one observed teratogenicity in dosages of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not immediately used, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions prior to the application; normally, 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen formed from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone reconstruction in order to ensure normal bone formation, thereby adding strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you will be treated with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have been used recently / used, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (particularly obese patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonylurea or insulin, the current dose of sulfonylurea and insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea and / or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea and received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with Metformin and a sulfonylurea in lowering the HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin decreased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took in addition placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypodiesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that in the context of monotherapy, Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>

<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and bear the inscription "15" on one side and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for pioglitazone for patients under the age of 18, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach complaints, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been assessed by clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred in the treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparing controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">The result of increased insulin sensitivity is the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients receiving pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the introduction of Thiazoldindione, including pioglitazone, a worsening of visual acuity was reported in diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated incidence of fractures was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment should be deputed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC from pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypersensitivity of the mother animal resulting from pregnancy and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the curgor and the refraction index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege were more often compared to placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under Metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone or pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction has rarely been reported on heart failure under pioglitazone, more frequently however when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medicine was conducted.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) were treated in patients treated with comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to be activated by activating specific nuclei receptors (PPAR-γ) activated by specific nuclei receptors (PPAR-γ), which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of the therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately set with insulin despite a three-month optimizing phase were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease in the baseline compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels and a slightly elevated LDL cholesterol level were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide reduced total plasma matrices and free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found in pioglitazone, while metformin and Gliclacide showed reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the inconvenience triglycerides, but also improved the post-dendial elevated triglyceride level, this both about an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups receiving either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance resemble the mother substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypersensitivity of the mother animal resulting in the gestation and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary tract was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment led to an increased frequency of colon tumors with two other thiazoldindione.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and bear the inscription "30" on one side and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated incidence of fractures was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease in the baseline compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the inconvenience triglycerides, but also improved the post-dendial elevated triglyceride level, this both about an effect on tryptriglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortals, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary vascularisation and the revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients who received comparison medication showed an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c spikes indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane may have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar (the full list is to be found in the package supplement).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted approval to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the marketing of Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injectable needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy can be used to change the hypoglycemia alert symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change with regard to starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can lead to a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of change to actraphane in the patient a dosage adjustment is required, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data gathered in two years of the open renewal study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / l (&lt; 357 µmol / l) revealed a decrease in the incidence of gout deaths so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against a gout in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment for a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the number of gnodes, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the top grades by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat were dose-proportionately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportionate increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. Plazebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of spine and trochanter continued; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was also maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Beaked to an intravenous reference dose was the average oral bio availability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability declined accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Circulation studies have shown that alendronate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg, but then rapidly redistributes to the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After IV administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate about 50% of the radioactive substance selected within 72 hours was excreted with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other pharmaceuticals through these transport systems.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Resorption in healthy adult subjects (women and men) was after the administration of ADROVANCE following nocturnal fast and two hours before intake of a meal the mean surface below the Serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 296.4 ng / h / ml (without taking into account endogenous vitamin D3 levels).</seg>
<seg id="1333">The mean maximum concentration in serum (CMAx) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng / ml and the median period up to the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In the liver, biotransformation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxymethylated in the liver and then metabolized to 1.25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form in the kidney.</seg>
<seg id="1335">Excretion In the application of radioactively marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects the average elimination of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in the fences after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is rapidly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there is no clinical data available, it can be expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly higher alendronate accumulation in the bone (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1401">Advagraf is administered to adult patients who have been transplanted to a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of transplanted organ by the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already in use in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation where the use of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a year (by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and examined, like Advagraf compared to Prograf / Prograft from the body.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Tremor, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (diarrhoea), kidney problems, increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), diabetes, increased potassium content of blood (hypercalemia), high blood pressure (hypertension) and insomnia (insomnia).</seg>
<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other components, Advagraf may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be cautious when others (in particular some herbal) drugs should be taken at the same time with Advantf, as the dosage or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Hard capsules, retardized yellow-orange gelatine capsules, printed in red ink on the light yellow capsular part with "0.5 mg" and on the orange capsule bottom with "W647"; they contain white powder.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; the formulation of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure measured as a valley level was comparable to both levels of both kidney and liver transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advantf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct night transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, an adjustment of the Advagraf dose scheme can take several days to reach the steady state.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition does not allow oral consumption of medicines in the first postoperative period, the tacrolimus treatment can be induced by intravenous (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application To suppress the graft rejection must be maintained by immunosuppression; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection. oral Advagraf therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection. oral Advagraf therapy should begin at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf Do a recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules be converted to a once daily dose of Advagraf, this change has to be done in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advantf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initialdose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must commence once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1426">In the case of adult patients undergoing Advantf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day should be taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advantf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, received prograf in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in pankreastransplant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintenance of blood tests in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of creatine incontinence and monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advantf When switching from a topical Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full-blood tacrolimus talc checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advantf, Dosage adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that might change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may take several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the lowering levels of tacrolimus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects which may result in tacrolimus deficiency or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; the formulation of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there is no clinical data available for the retardiated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There is still no clinical data available for the retardiated formulation of Advagraf for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplants and transplants in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions leading to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advantf, is to be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tacrolimus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a chamber or septum treated as cardiomyopathy could be observed, which can therefore occur under Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In patients with a rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption, advant hard capsules, retardized, lactose are provided with special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or decrease the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering simultaneous supplementation of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentration (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the MacroTech antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs called tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thereby increase hormone exposure, precautionary measures should be taken particularly cautiously in decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn to possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is a risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hypercalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side effect profile of immunosuppressant drugs is often inaccurate due to the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- and lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific series of lymphocytes genes.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 treatment transplanted patients, 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases were used as a primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies corresponded to the observations in the large studies in which prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter trial with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">A chronic graft rejection, the bronchiolitis of obliteral syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, it occurred in 21,7% of cases for the development of bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) compared to the number of patients who were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33,3%) in the transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (WHO, J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicenter trial with oral prograf was performed to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancreas and kidney transplantation which received a randomised trial tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">In 155 patients (65 only intestine, 75 liver and gut and 25 multiviszeral transplants), the published clinical results of a monocentric clinical trial with oral prograf showed an updated rate of survival of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional application of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, which lead to valley mirrors between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplantation (Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolised before excretion, whereby the excretion takes place mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients prescribed by Prograf (twice daily) in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advantf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there is no clinical data available for the retardiated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advice is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of use depend on whether advant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but manufactured according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Lawyer is another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions was examined.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advatas in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advatants (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyer should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII-defect, on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">During the following haemorrhagic events factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.E. by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose, a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should be directed at the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always indicative of the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directional IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, following conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-tightness) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs appearing in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of whom have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the expected decrease of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10th - 14 postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate revealed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">Furthermore, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) had been identified as a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients treated with ADVATE treated patients with Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a persisting peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, isolated cases of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to assess the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for licensing Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures within the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, where Li-Fraumeni-Cancer occurred in the substructure, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP produces a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compound-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerobaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the severity of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aeronaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, patients under Aerobaze showed a reduction in symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who alone received desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeromaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, which are other drugs called noradrenergic active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may not be used in patients who suffer from contra-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urine retention (high blood pressure), hyperthyroosis (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyroosis (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyroidism (hyperfunction of the thyroid) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit to transport Aerobaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, crushing or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), we should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment may be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerobaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors respectively within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, Pergolid, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which are perorally or nasal as a declining rhinologic medicine (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data will not suffice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerobaze were not checked in patients with liver or liver dysfunction, and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or intensification of the headache) must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerobaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours before the testing of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with disloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the use of Aerobaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrikoric properties of pseudoephedrine, aeromaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be informed, however, that in very rare cases it may lead to a lightheadedness which may lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible sequels.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measurements of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympaimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving ainaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerobaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerobaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perortal application of aeromaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydeschloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure after the use of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and of rabbits was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceutical covigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, seizure, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous hepatic cancer were also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg / ml of lyophiliate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight trials involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials for seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadriggans, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the scores of 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria the decrease in the scores after six weeks treated with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Amerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been completed and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not amplified while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should be informed, however, that in very rare cases there may be dizziness, which may lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common adverse event was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadin, and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were given.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses given to desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over a period of ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measurements of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be classified as an alternative to the duration of symptoms alternatively in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a representative for further forms of urticaria because the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology is similar in the different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the history of histamine is a causative factor in all of the urinary diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation following a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise Desloratadin and experience higher substance strain (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a sucrose Isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for antihistamines received a daily total dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can be extrapolated by adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">During a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with the psychomotor functions.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a amplification of the alcohol-induced impairment of the performance nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the induced rhinitis caused by seasonal allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of preitus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose trial with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation following a daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC- and CMAx values of Desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company accepts its proposal to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human, because people have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the inoculation of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus that is contained in the vaccine as "foreign-foreign," and trains antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as a body alien) has been stoned off and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are attending a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over the age of four, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked out which antiviral medicinal drugs the patient has previously taken and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of pritonavir twice a day and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of apgenase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral drugs, Agenerase reduces the HIV levels in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids do not cure AIDS, but can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without the ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, enhanced with low dose ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with insignificant concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, the viral load also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children, previously treated with protease inhibitors, were limited to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults treated earlier with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase enhanced viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, under agenase, there was a stronger descent of the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headache, diarrhoea (flatulence), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal preparation for treating depression) or medicines that are just as degraded as amerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, patients who take apgenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines outweigh the risks of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years in comparison with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic converter Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefits of amrease in combination with knight avir in patients who previously did not occupy a protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally supposed to be under exceptional circumstances, as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than by Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase Capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the amplifying addition of knight avir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amicase in combination with low doses of knights or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochromed P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of krononavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Riton avir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticosteroids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovestatin and Simvastatin strongly depends on CYP3A4, a concurrent administration of asterase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for breath withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycosis of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of 4 and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Regeneration should be reduced to 5, if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged anti-retroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hematoma occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochromed P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width A generase with ritonavir must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabolised mainly via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction of the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenah virus and, if possible, examine the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508%, for CMAx, is increased by 30%, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for the use of amoxin in combination with Didanosin, but because of the sacramental component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenue of didanosin and apgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with apgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69 times compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without simultaneously using Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in interactions with apgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids do not be taken at the same time as amrease as it can result in resorption dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrently taking Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, Agenerase's simultaneous administration with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticosteroids unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovestatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma level are expected with simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time by amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Thus, Agenerase may not be used together with Midazolam's orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam for 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for breath withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, as amprenavir can be modified with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with concurrent administration of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactose-related substances; however, it is not known whether Amprenavir is passing into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, given by evaporation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to a drop in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of Agenerase or any other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fat, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (bull jaws).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bull jaws) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients were treated under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without requiring treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received agenase along with low dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents viral Gag- and gag pol- polyprotein precursors with the result of an education of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in the case of chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / ritonavir dosages - as in other knights avir-based treatment regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be studied genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure of more than 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I62V, V82A / C / F / M, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I84V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all four Fosamprenavir resistance trails, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, in which an antiretroviral medication failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 25 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 25 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (four out of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may have adverse effects on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which treated with PI pretreated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly performed with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Riton avir in relation to the time-adjusted average change from baseline value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-leaching threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of uncontrolled aspirin is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of whom 152 was treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unbiased" amperase should be taken into account when optimizing therapy with PI treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">By contrast, 508% has been increased by 30% for CMAx, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was therefore unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous dietary intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows large distribution volumes and an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream to the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce CYP3A4 must induce or inhibit / inhibit CYP3A4, should be administered cautiously if they are simultaneously given with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those employed in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were found in male animals that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- x (rat) of the exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanisms for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas have not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data in humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included reverse-mutation tests, mouse lymphom test, micronucleus test on rats and chromosome aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of agenase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of juveniles treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">A number of minor changes including thymus juggling and minor skeletal changes were observed in a systemic plasma exposure, significantly lower than (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the amplifying addition of knight avir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">In patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Regeneration should be reduced to 27, if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction of the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508%, for CMAx, is increased by 30%, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure to both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, to administer rifabutin along with apgenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, even though there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a 22% reduction of the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nettle in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the conservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the expected benefits of "unbiased" amperase should be taken into account during therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines which induce CYP3A4 must induce or inhibit / inhibit CYP3A4, should be administered cautiously if they are simultaneously given with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible; therefore, the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were found in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8 x (rat) of the human exposure after a twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2095">Studies on the toxicity of juveniles treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2096">These results indicate that in juveniles the metabolism pathways are not yet fully mature, so that amprenavir or other critical components of the formulation (z.</seg>
<seg id="2097">Agenerase's solution to intake is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of knight avir "boosterter" Agenerase solution for intake was not documented either with PI pre-treated patients or with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than by Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">The patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of the Agenerase solution to intake and low dose ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dosage adjustment for amprenavir is not deemed necessary, an application of an Agenerase solution is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycosis, Agenerase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years of age, pregnant women, patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Concurrent administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects, such as arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Regeneration should be set in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2110">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug - 49 depended factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2111">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hematoma occur.</seg>
<seg id="2112">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction of the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2113">508%, for CMAx, is increased by 30%, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2114">Concurrently taking with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to related side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism associated with PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2115">Based on data on 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, Midazolam expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Midazolam following oral administration of Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="2116">The potential risk for the human being is unknown. Agenerase's solution to intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fetus to the included propylene glycol (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2117">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactose-related substances; however, it is not known whether Amprenavir is passing into breast milk in humans.</seg>

<seg id="2191">In case of an application of imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed, which necessitated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty in urination that necessitated emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">No clinical experience has been found to apply imiquimod cream immediately after treatment with other cutaneous procedures applied to the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and pericanal areas.</seg>

<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there is currently no data available about long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable therapies should be considered in superficially basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the use of pre-treated tumors is not recommended.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinical keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after discontinuing treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment can be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / foetal development, fetching or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) cannot be quantified by a single or repeated topical application, no recommendation can be applied during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most reported and probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Adverse events reported from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial from 185 with Imiquimod-Cream reported side effects below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly with the application of the imiquimod cream in the related side effect, were in these studies a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects of 252 placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This placebo-controlled review of the clinical signs shows that placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod spread often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / aborting / scrapping (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The assessment of the clinical signs indicated according to the protocol indicates that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe shortening and canning (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was found with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent single oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotony normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentration of the alpha interferon and other cytokines has been demonstrated after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy was significantly superior to a complete healing of the genital warts in an imiquimine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated with imiquimod treated the genital warts completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of imiquimod with five times of application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficielle basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data available from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured, and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of imiquimod over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week treatment period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a cohesive 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairless scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external genital warts, actinical keratose and superficient basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week) for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratose was observed in the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentration of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of imiquimod after topical application on MC-sick skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days per week did not induce tumors at the point of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to be considered very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the non-active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this instructions, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignizen (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and the anus (anus) is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortion, especially in the face - hence early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>

<seg id="2253">If other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream is after sexual intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of treatment vary depending on inclinations, basal cell carcinoma and acute keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream onto the clean, dry skin with the genital warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area under it (see paragraph 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A degraded number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster, or you can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Mostly these are lighter skin reactions, which disappear within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, peeling, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, irritability, or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with recovering devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring magnitude of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to Genzyme Europe B.V. to transport aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in individual steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyms may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any adverse side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment, in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the phase 3 clinical trial, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase are expected to form, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in resuming treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to proceed cautiously due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the infusion begins with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be reabsorbed by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data available to newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions associated with aldurazyms observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table for the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration stand and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesired drug interactions with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a predominantly severe form of follow-up and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a serum conversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of follow-up in patients at the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (resp. up to premature ejection from the study), 13 / 45 patients did not present an antibody being detectable by radioimmunostaining (RIP) assay, including 3 patients in whom there was never a serum conversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody tides.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on the enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substratum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken from cells into the lysosomes, most likely via manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients were of the central phenotype and only one patient showed the difficult phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6-Minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyms showed an improvement in lung function and mobility compared to the placebo group, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open renewal study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) up to the end of the study showed normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint (expected Percentage normal FEV, distance in 6-minute walking, motion area of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year open Phase 2 trial investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe form of follow-up and 4 with middle form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dose increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow-up showed normal mental development speed, whereas older patients with severe form were only limited or not progressing in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in a unique gift, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2357">If aslimta is administered together with cisplatin, an "anti-medication" (anti-vomiting) and fluids (in order to prevent a fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or if certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed or reduced or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the median survival time was 8.3 months compared with docetaxel compared to 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to permit the transport of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-gift as well as the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose Pemetrexed a minimum of 5 doses of folic acid have to be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetremixed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood mural or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Following the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop non-hematological toxicity (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient reaches the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if there is a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 in patients after 2 dose reducers or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older, there is an increased side effect risk compared to patients at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dosage adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin level and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone-level immunosuppression and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients before the absolute number of neutrophils has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- zytente has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ again.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-atmatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia were treated when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed should be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for therapy with Pemetremixed should avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with a clinically significant fluid retention in the translucellular space a drainage of the ergometer before Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed, if this agent was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible impairment of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to treatment advice to obtain advice on the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in decreased Pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of Pemetrexed should be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible deterioration of the reproductive capacity is indicated by Pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the start of treatment to obtain advice on the locking of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed goes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomised cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiotherapy were reported in patients treated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking the thyme dylate synthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit of an over-median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients who were only covered with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) associated with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was demonstrated in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted from an improvement in the pulmonary function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a worsening of the lung function during the time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC followed a median survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival was in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0,047), adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separately controlled, controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pre-treatment is similar to docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who are taking Alli and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can't break down some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food ingested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients receiving the Alli 60 mg group had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, flatus (winch) with bowel movement, pull ldr, greasy / oily chair, drop-off secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from long-term Malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract) or at cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a licence for placing orlistat GSK on the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 as there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • Chronic Malabsorption syndrome • Cholestase • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dose of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who are alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional contraceptive measures to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene in normal range remained.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplement of multivitamin before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of one single dose Amiodarone, a small number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observes a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to any symptoms or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects resulting from the assimilating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-remnant of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times a day, blocking the absorption of approximately 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomisation) was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2,8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean change in LDL cholesterol in orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral presentation of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general therapeutic doses of not metabolized orlistat in the plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonic ring) and M3 (M1 after fission of the N-Formyl-Leucin group) were identified in a study of obese patients presenting approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment, since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize nutrition-related concomitants: • Beginning already a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial dessert, as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction. • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies that are moderate cause of nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine which can be used as an anti-medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate cause of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong causes of nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Alopos (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloe in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous gift of palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, aloxi is not used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not tumor the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-State- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A population-based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromaine, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences of using palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (altogether 633 patients), which were at least related to aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective therapy for aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) which was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg ondansetron which were given intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from the studies of moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in individual doses ranging from 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionally in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days comparable to a single intravenous administration of 0.75 mg, the CMAx was higher after the single dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a one-time intravenous bolus injection, the total body office was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearances 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies evidence showed that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose equivalent to 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because alxi is used in humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is considered low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report that recommended the use of Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue has damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminoferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon showed data that shows the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retarded more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug uses an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected layers (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used to treat infections caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">During the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar responses: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin dogs, about 90% of both groups of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small retinas, abrasions or sewn ulcers.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a licence for the transport of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be stopped, the ointment must be diligently wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection commenced.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or worsening of the infected area after 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazol, the middle retapamin AUC (0-24) and CMAx according to topical application of 1% Retapamine ointment increased to decreased skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and foetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that used altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the administration was about 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passwort (formerly Pleurotus passacerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site contains ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibit the ptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding sites and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of reapamulin appear at least some infection forms due to the local prevalence of resistance, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retafamulin versus S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to S.aureus treatment, the presence of stems with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on scraped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% RetapamMedulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skinned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in human liver microsomen in vitro was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with the low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid gland changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-micronucleus test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus achieving a maximum exposure of 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity have been established.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the license agreement commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and included in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates to the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should finish the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you have not been specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bond or a gazelle, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination consisting of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan, consisting of two doses, can be put to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix adults, which has been approved since 1996, and the Vaccine Twinrix children, which has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given children as part of a vaccination consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix included adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98% and 100% of the vaccinated children led to the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to a 6-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.a. a licence for the transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The vaccination plan for primers with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a screening chime is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monocytic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully guaranteed whether immunocompetent individuals who responded to a hepatitis vaccination will need a screening chime as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in the case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the use of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons suffering from immune system disorders, insufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels may be reached, so that additional doses may be needed in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could result in a suboptimal impeccable success, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, the atmosphere can be injected subcutanously, as in these cases, bleeding can occur after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier Thiomer and preservative-based vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 inoculations were given to a total of 1027 vaccine doses at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the combination of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects following the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received the Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% for the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to 39.6% of subjects who received the Ambirix compared to 36.2% of subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambient x group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after inoculation with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">Statistically, the proportion of vaccines reported on severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies, which were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds, after the completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of primers, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was similar to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the vaccine of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis, and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotectories and Seroconversions, similar to the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virusory food and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways, such as bathing in water contaminated by waste water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the whole vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccine doses, (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination point), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic) has been shown to you / your child.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix becomes people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / is or if you / your child is undergoing a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take / take other medicines (including those you can get without prescribing) or if you / your child had recently been vaccinated or received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or that this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is imperative that they be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) if you have an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Very common (more than 1 fall per 10 injected doses): • pain or discomfort at the incision site or redness • Matching • irritability • headaches • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">Bite frequently (up to 1 fall per 10 injected doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (above 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 vaccinated cans) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include limited or extended surcharges that can be itchy or bloated, swelling of the eyes and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like symptoms including chills, muscular and joint pain seizures, dizziness, misperceptions such as tingling and "ant running," multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or mobility of some parts of the body, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, disruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Impotence inflammations of some blood vessels unhappiness or disease, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and stomach pain change the liver function tests lymphatic junctive swelling to bleedings or to bruising (bruising) caused by the decrease of the amount of blood platelet.</seg>
<seg id="2803">Notify your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects affect you / your child significantly or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this packing supplement.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incompletely enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via Gastrostomieschl (through the abdominal wall in the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (pseudo-drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidic content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved in "exceptional circumstances," due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, limited information was given to this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in the neonatal age (within the first 28 days of living).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete cell defect that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use of hyperammonium encephalopathy in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein uptake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamethphosphate synthetase or ornithimcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with care in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate on young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain also found a decrease in brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one undesired event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armordium topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to a urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excreting excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifal form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through haemmodialysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and eventually substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first onset of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including the heterozygous form of the ornithimcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonium encephalopathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with cyclic disturbances or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in plasma after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medicine is secreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrate did not have any unclaimant effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children who are not able to swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrointestinal dye or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamethphosphate synthetase or ornithimcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armordium topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to a urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on tests on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring scoop contains 0,95 g, the average measuring scoop of 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication using a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the toxic waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If your lab tests are carried out, tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not use AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, delayed hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were also observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in blood mural (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, uncomfortable skin odor, rash, kidney dysfunction, weight gain, and abnormal lab results.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS after the expiration date indicated on the box and the container after "User to" stated expiry date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">How AMMONAPS looks and contents of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish colour and oval shape, and they are equipped with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If your lab tests are carried out, tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on the same single doses orally or via a stomach fistel (hose that passes through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal tube (hose that is fed through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped measuring spoon of granulate from the container. • Use a straight edge, e.g. a knife edge over the top edge of the spoon to remove excess granulate. • Take the recommended amount of tablespoons granules out of the tank.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without" stop uplift "(an anomalous measured value in electrocardiography or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was frequently employed (a short tube which remains in the artery in order to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as cximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization).</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instable angina / non - ST midwife attack (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous 0.1 mg / kg of an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If subsequently a PCI is performed in the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure a bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous tightening of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the inox dose is rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalium against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which were included in the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the submission of the bivalirudin-bolus with an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Serious hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible clots. • severe uncontrolled hypertonia and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the hemorrhages occur in patients suffering from arterial occlusion, patients who undergo a percutaneous Koronarintervention (PCI) can, in principle, perform bleeding throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, monitoring the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivalirudine returns the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregators), these substances will increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with bivalium with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in each case are regularly controlled.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, the development of embryonic / fetal development, binding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or ennoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalium group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding, as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidruid plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood spot, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study involving a bivalium in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of overdosing, the treatment with bivalium is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalium, a direct and specific thrombining inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as to the anion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin on thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombine slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine with serum from patients with paraffin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininducized thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce platelet aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalirudine shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect supported by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the case of a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalium should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1- year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for the patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before the angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before Angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intraarterial, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood spot, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudine were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous correlation (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivalirudine as peptide goes through a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent reuse of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination is performed in patients with normal kidney function following a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 times of clinical progression-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events caused by longer-term physiological strain in response to non-homoeostaatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to that in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different to acting insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting Huminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes in which insulin cannot function effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">The reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism mean that insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may change the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or interruption of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be subject to strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the type of action of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, Salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympathetic olytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin, and reserves may be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulism enters into human breast milk, but generally insulin occurs neither in the mother's milk nor is resorbed to oral health.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesired treatments known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organ classes and classified by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog-ger, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous dispensing of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Following a glucoagination, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin-lulism in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportionate glucoseside effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucoseside effect, just like Humacting.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucoseside effect about 2 hours earlier than Huminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-denial glycaemic control is achieved, as given with normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin lulis was put in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denial control was achieved than with normal insulin insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulis is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control such as human normal insulin, which is given 2 microsaries before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal started compared to normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to normal insulin insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
