the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings extensions .... Open the card menu Tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that even more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on optional crashes . then you can view the page , which has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the View Fil@@ ters module ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . by default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ It@@ em , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder speci@@ fies the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy det@@ ecting the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( where , consequently , display errors may occur due to limitations when displaying the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . parameters are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and those boxes need space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when square is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always possible to divide areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles emerge that are as square as possible . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry on the View menu item View Editor . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get that was developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the picture gallery module can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , allowing you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a rotation panel to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the file names will be shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and what sub@@ folders are to be included .
when saving files in HTML , specify where the HTML page is to be stored .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a rotary field , up to what level the sub@@ folders will be included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy original images to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ y the original images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment section of the comments box can be used to specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different depth of colour for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view the navigation area under the window or with the F@@ 9 key symbol .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page denied access to this browser , change browser recognition to one of the following options .
changes the ID in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access to browsers based on Moz@@ illa . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to access the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE &apos;s Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ tis ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ tis ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ cam ; registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for log@@ out in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will also use as an alert library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be altered .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; cuts recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change the ones by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ cam ; your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive unit . the camera then appears via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions are slow over the serial port , this connection has become obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see preview images or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about digi@@ tis ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modul@@ ating modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the si@@ lls with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping of images works everywhere : you can place an image in a different part of the al@@ b tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter will only work on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Colle@@ ctions : are a way to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . selecting from the tool@@ bar or sorting view albums after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview list . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports entering keywords for single photos in the My keywords list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . all photos of the album are always part of the collection . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be shown in this album in the picture window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the preview images are generated . you can avoid using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit about settings digi@@ plug ; choose the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes .
the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all about what it was about &amp; digi@@ tis ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them . you can reach all the functions that have been edited &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by right @-@ clicking on either F@@ 4 ... or selecting the right mouse button and editing ... selecting . in the editing section you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ tis ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , it can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image . this is why this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ line ; provides two options for rotation . the simplest one is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc . ) .
if you remove a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete it , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or de@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ am@@ sli@@ der@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords list@@ ings , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are saved in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on a new keyword , this keyword will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by right @-@ clicking on the keyword and selecting delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting keyword editing in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as the album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use keywords , you first have to provide your photos with keyword . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can click them on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the previ@@ ews of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be shifted using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all related images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
includes all database elements : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
beside the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as shown above . you can search this search here however as live search , which always filtering what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is executed . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . the text box Save Search is used to make your request a name in my search list . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit the search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with Search Group / Del@@ ete , or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others through logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create .
&amp; digi@@ tis ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by means of a Schw@@ ell@@ ert the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere on the icon of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand colour scheme : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it and move it while you drag the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including shell files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the LED from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras lumin@@ ous .
from the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select a preview from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then these are also executed on the other picture . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion operations work directly from the illuminated table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom function works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom regulator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . we focus on the process for digital fot@@ ograph@@ ers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , previ@@ ew@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , converts , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a certain photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to which you can access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you need to incorporate something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be somehow organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of things . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option Met@@ adata to be saved to the file &apos;s settings page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to every photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the next work .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let people see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I am telling you this of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as you want , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . K@@ DE even provides you a spell check . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will tell you a second time for publishing .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different town without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now moving with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic data .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a copyright and design@@ ates the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the vendor field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change this metadata embedded in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failures , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , dissemin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tion
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may not be trusted for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
therefore they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cost @-@ effective program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which appears to work wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for you . your manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives .
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors found by S@@ MA@@ RT announce the imminent failure . these are especially reading errors and swap meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as also by this one over@@ voltage . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage drops that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also provide protection for the modem .
while a over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run the system in order . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the cost of avoiding it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can you consider for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS file system and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . not@@ ebooks already account for the share of the@@ fts 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ ened file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive gets you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . so , 6 % of all PCs are often affected by data loss . so , backup your data to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records , or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring up your back@@ ups to the stairs , to the neighboring house , to your office or similar .
there is another benefit of physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only dup@@ lic@@ ates the difference of the files that have actually been changed .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC saved in the image file , maintaining associated X@@ MP files , preserving memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new disk has been recognized by the system , but do not mount it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted reside / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ I ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GI@@ F . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already making D@@ NG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of application and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw file . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam ; edit , then you should add metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to get a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug your digital camera ; connect them to your computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it will try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished -@@ indicator will appear at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . using the page bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab@@ s metadata displays internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata page strip of the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the photos were securely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button selected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download or download the selected albums , select a dialog with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , sorted as usual folders . select the album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you need to select them first and then delete the selected er@@ ase .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos deleted from the camera . the photos are not moved to &amp; k@@ de ; they are deleted completely . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do so using the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the picture was made in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens three more options which are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when you download it . or , in capital letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , which was digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the metadata section metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
auto @-@ rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver that information , it lets &amp; digi@@ code ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the extension button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ tis ; this will be used to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album .
this option is usually off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the option Dat@@ es @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ code ; you see where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that we have many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ d or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Excel Tool by Phi@@ l Har@@ vey . it uses the character enco@@ ded coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; try to give as much control over your work sequences as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to edit the settings menu in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set to set preview or image processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in case of a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations like e.g. employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since this is the picture other &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ a quot ; .
IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this means that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam .
save images as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is placed in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tis ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the light signal of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the LED , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data needs more time to expand and un@@ pack . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression ratio .
this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the adjustment loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata has not yet been supported , but found itself in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in more detail in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the highlights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , due to the inability of your camera to capture the highlights , as continuous white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results , as it shows the highlights in various rose tones . la@@ stly , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you will have the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for invo@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ ten@@ er correction as you are carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how it should be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . information such as color information from a color space in the other is to be translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you all save your profile .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not adjust for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could you manually correct instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface it can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the previ@@ ews .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes activate the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left shows a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Auto detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on .
check out if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu C@@ ameras by the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog option for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set &amp; digi@@ plug the conversation ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without questions . otherwise , you will need to save the changes to the button changes .
you can also edit &amp; digi@@ kam the display of the welcome screen ; it may speed up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam .
the setting When starting to search for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this will extend the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , asked &amp; digi@@ kam it ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ tis ; to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the section Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window displaying file name , current file number , zoom factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you will not be able to recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it by saving file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing and recre@@ ating Edi@@ ting from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and trace C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB file for a moment longer than the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , down the picture , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the selection menu .
in order to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view by using the Es@@ c key . normally , you can also edit the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the &amp; digi@@ kam window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select print job from the Album pane Ex@@ porting . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the edge again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the user button , there is a knob More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always performed when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can thus quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this feature is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keyword Search can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword in the IP@@ TC array .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , If you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created a rule , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :

this tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or sc@@ anners may have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should allow links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image expenses are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easy for all , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about colour management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Wy@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I chose to work exclusively in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor is s@@ RGB to s@@ RGB , then you must either al@@ locate your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic deco@@ ding and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ correc@@ ting Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the Leu@@ st@@ ressing values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
comparison : this method adju@@ sts the light intensity re@@ actor in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic deco@@ ding : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright limit tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a re @-@ image of all values in between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a bit limited since there is a color space with 8 bits per color . if you are too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
the hist@@ ogram shows a dynamic change as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or down@@ grade the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a color film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you only need the sli@@ der field for the application described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . under the graph , three slide gates are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the control and to take care of how the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
exit values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a pale picture as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the screen &apos;s input values for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode is further helpful .
for example , if you move a short@@ wave to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker .
in the preview of the original photos a red marker is to be seen . if you move this mark on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
if you use this method and the three pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shade , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shades of shade and sun were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are on the right side : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is the tool to create great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same point in the colour channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for that purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black and white is a work step , because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore like the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the pictures of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Add tool framework can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce over@@ rides it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three dimensional frame .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before cutting previously .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the Image template menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , simply send an email in english to &amp; digi@@ kam , digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you will need to set your sten@@ cil folder to the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but it creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process colours combined with minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera has often been applied in internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a follow @-@ up filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . you can call it with the menu entry for correc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
but you should be careful with this as the results don &apos;t work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ er and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will produce .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original .
the threshold value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and hence plastic fla@@ ws in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image processed ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Det@@ ox Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing mostly achieves better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value 1 should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor .
this is most often caused by a previously executed blu@@ r filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the edge . note however that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations do not make changes that are not immediately visible , but leave behind unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you are reading and comp@@ ressing images , eg JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by severely mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smoo@@ thes the blu@@ r of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows for a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film bas@@ tion or CCD noise , a high value sha@@ ft@@ like patterns will produce . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ ths &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specify how many times the algorithm is going to go through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle step width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles have a long run@@ time . therefore , you should select this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain in default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the picture . the area indicated by the radius moves over the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus fixes smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise tips are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or black@@ smi@@ thing occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details pane .
g@@ amma : controls the tolerance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more rau@@ cous , but also gre@@ ens the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it can be too high .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied to the default settings .
the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than blur@@ ring a picture . use tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ sed images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it creates some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons storing and loading do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film bas@@ kets on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ trac@@ tional method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and load it again in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are created in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an intersection of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ si@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they cut the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may cause the necessary shutter time under certain circumstances , which is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale using digital cameras and film sc@@ anners . the vi@@ gn@@ etting gra@@ ding tool applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture .
with three controls you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the dation from &amp; digi@@ kam . image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction on an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the second degree coefficient shows the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the fourth dig@@ its correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth dig@@ its . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners &apos; has the inver@@ ted parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thereby results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values .
the correct sp@@ her@@ ical correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . it is best to perform this correction first . if you re @-@ trim an image and then perform a ton@@ ar @-@ like correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ieren Zu@@ trimm@@ ing from the Image Processing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects like shots from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ F@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to set film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the Inclu@@ ded Film Cor@@ rection option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of the film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Fil@@ ming filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ particle effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special gallery @-@ like , street @-@ like , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are often required , to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ particle effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . the lines that outline the outlines in drawing are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch out .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving defines your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines eman@@ ating from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by random shifting of pixels and simul@@ ating the blu@@ r of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the paint tank in the picture and blur@@ ring it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the picture into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . thus , it gives your images a wet look . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ tis ; image editing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . when you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Cra@@ fting or Trans@@ forming Refle@@ ctions Menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les are used exactly for this purpose . each magni@@ fication for photo magni@@ fication can be stored as a text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cli@@ pping button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
when cutting the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is assigned .
trimm@@ ing After page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sized photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
if you use the cro@@ pping tool for the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ ali@@ ght help make it possible to show help , so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visual harmon@@ i@@ ously .
the golden center will provide smoo@@ ther aid lines if you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this kind .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be published more dynam@@ ical a static object .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can become invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the knob pres@@ ets you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the Transformation cro@@ pping from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image slightly after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are made around a fixed point of the reference point so called . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is s@@ me@@ ared a little . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you will get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cro@@ pping from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate both horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single layer this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two coatings produce twice as much compression and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens based on file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in image processing will change ; you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept . see Con@@ figuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . thereby redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour , very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the video converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . this allows you to see more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in feature films to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program to play .

if you swap the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good then you can do the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to rev@@ ise are included in &amp; digi@@ kam . their description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , mas@@ king , etc ; Use a consistent dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colours used can be adapted to the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to view the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it and move it while you drag the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the palette palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is selected under the button Color , the color is past@@ ed from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writing another ; depending on whether the over@@ writing mode has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if a further color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and displays it in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; open in a bil@@ l@@ ard ; component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar only opens the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains open files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; can also note your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice and change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page are to be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Renew@@ able Char@@ ge page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or om@@ it the program each time .
the Open@@ ing page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time will be asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of oriented graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . it produces representations according to the spring spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce spring model for ung@@ eri@@ ghted graphs . it uses the fruit @-@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circle according to the description of Six und Tol@@ sto@@ y , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should be able to accept the graph@@ ite file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( judged or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ lit graphs ) .
if this setting is checked , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse poin@@ ter ; -@@ Element to get more help to this item ( if any ) .

&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . then , a dialog appears where you can choose to create the icon from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
re@@ stores the last revers@@ al step . if you do not have a step back , this function is de@@ activated .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;
do not change the symbol , but set the current character color to the color of the dot on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for icons , background , and symbol bars .
with buttons adding ... , editing ... and removing , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent Pixel or Display rulers and set a color : or a chess board as transparency display . you can also adjust the size of the chess board : the Kar@@ os to Klein , Medium and Great as well as the Color 1 : and Color 2 : select .
reading the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the menu entry image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears when you can replace the default duc@@ r@@ he custom to select your image . see the preview and customize the range of your needs before clicking on the scan button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Im@@ port &gt; Screen Saver menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen shot modes :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place photos of your bud@@ dy online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the Ex@@ porter module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you are using the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . it is therefore your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration the module can send pictures to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking on Yes , you will get the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . it will be shown in the next section .
when the Ex@@ porter module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you will need sp@@ elling per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions .
the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server will start .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the picture as tags during the up@@ loading .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ li@@ ly options allow you to set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width degrees are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ r@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above dialog appears then . to manage a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog takes the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and zoom . always repeat this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ a@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg . Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all its related images . select a folder from where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the standard color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der preview screensaver allows you to customize some of the settings from the album rider for the preview images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press ab@@ ort to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information . this can be found in P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please watch I@@ VA@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that want to be packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can start creating the module via extras MPEG slide au .
the images you select are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start the production of the movie with the button enco@@ ded . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go quickly or in all calm a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings right down button .
the print job allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your saved images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect ie cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it allows only a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
the stack processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . clicking on the images will allow you to add more images to a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images and add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button Rem@@ ove Images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting a comment in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG among images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions with Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File name option ensures that the file name of the images is shown in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option Images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the pictures is not used in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the transition effect . so you should test it before you present your presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , any transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current preview images .
when you click on the person using the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see the picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can mit &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and displayed in the context menu the entry Categories @-@ Editor . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also specify a date to be searched ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , images showing Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the User Manual for &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but would rather like to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry K@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the Tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minute sections .
the Tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be shown in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time frame in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create through the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are group@@ ed into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you &apos;ll see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
la@@ stly , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently , all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of this page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . thus , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a log supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder a web browser , after the pages have been created , will be launched . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings have all three related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time recording the picture information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not yet again .
mit &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . they can import other files into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you are creating a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can call via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; past@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , since the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File import menu ... choose , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ ell the category Person@@ s of the file to import ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is the name of your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you &apos;ll be asked what categories of the file to import and which categories these categories match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured .
in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) determining information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today you will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top of its images . it is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can access a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will learn the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided that you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
look at the dialog that is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select an ann@@ ot@@ ation and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up full membership groups , i.e. , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list box above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the modules modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it can be that the modules with &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures using the &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help Menu . don &apos;t tell me , I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , which makes it possible that some modules with &amp; K@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; past@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the image preview right now .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , it will work &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar , you will see the window that you have not added any information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures that will give you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jesus is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in three lists with a text box , you can set people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again , if you type information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the pictures within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by means that the names used are moved upwards , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California .
on the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a hyper@@ tro@@ upe , a special icon is displayed .
in the Not@@ ation dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it in alphabetical order .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window out of a frame by pulling it out of the window pane .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button , which offers , among other things , the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to view this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . see this in the picture .
if you select the entry image in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t set any filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will appear which you can see in the picture .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you may have saved the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images . however , you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and paste files from folders and paste them back into it . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid jum@@ bling your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end there are those left you may want to make for others and click on the Current View menu to lock the menu entry All except the current view .
this allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry Images , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , everyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime . for this reason &amp; past@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have to enter via the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information should be displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available on the viewer right @-@ click .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped the slide show through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer will use the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in to the center of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the zoom effect .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation key sets the zoom , so that every pixel is on the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus button .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to only mark the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images onto a printer to get the pictures designed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while watching one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you will see a picture in which the attributes A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you want to see all the images you edit , print or whatever has been selected , simply add all of the images to one with notes . this is described in detail . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in the particular preview view , you can add features to the images by simply clicking the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to do the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pop @-@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ sorted item . if you only want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the box locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a field of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different layout , you can adjust it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , pull the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating view : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ ois bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ois bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view allows you to save with View window arrangement ... Save . a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select View View menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes ... menu View , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , however , a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the picture editing to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop down sel@@ ector you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously further divided and adaptive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colours .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 5 ( 25 ) will calculate additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on , Change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last adjustment for Ren@@ der@@ ns quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a / Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the scene , select File import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; want to import , write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also include .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your retention and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type plates .
you can adjust the object &apos;s range of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for displac@@ ements , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects like the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you tick High Detailed Lo@@ fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section , you can specify the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window classi@@ fications . in the section window orders , it explains how to create and save window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list Pres@@ ence window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by adding the button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the new column will create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Down anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with card menu you will receive a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything without error , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the tools available on the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will now have to use these menus and icons frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . simply click a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they view the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert Fin@@ ite Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also indicates the level , though at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can fold out the item for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift .
in this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit below the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property view . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material , because you still need to enter settings for the pig@@ ments . always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see any color on the header and the sphere in preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ hand . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should be able to execute simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be easily created as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : click on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have shifted the floor around one unit down .
of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , the ball will give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ colour and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter button .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what options are offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer uses hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saving will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command to be revers@@ ed . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edi@@ ts undo .
store the current window arrangement and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add tool@@ boxes for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the usage of &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can use when you click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ O ; or press Return .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the modus oper@@ and@@ i of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is checked , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still viewing the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option you save &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show , this folder in the browser window opens .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ casing ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least issues and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu includes reports to report problems or requests .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users of &amp; show photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ casing is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ casing ; .
and show@@ casing ; try to give as much control over its work sequences as possible . there are many options that modify the behavior of &amp; show@@ casing . to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ piece menu in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the exposure indicator range , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - and over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity , the colors should be in contrast with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ front ; features a side bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image processing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan ima@@ gery that does not do more than scanning and storing images .
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan ima@@ gery that does no longer scan and save images . &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a given folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information you need on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; the command sc@@ ann@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ an ) does not handle these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sli@@ der will result in a break and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; Ch@@ as@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without searching for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , that folder is used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button 1 starts the K@@ DE Help using the &amp; gu@@ es@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE Über @-@ Dialog for &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; output .

below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking into the player window and set up Global button cuts ... choosing the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this lets you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function breaks might look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules exist and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be attached to any K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this usually uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or piece length ) could be retri@@ eved .
volume Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files in the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be selected . to add an entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item titles ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do cleaning tasks . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ sq@@ .@@ amar@@ oc@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the suff@@ ix amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and yet is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right one for you . and if you still find it hard to decide , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base directory of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the System Requi@@ rements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up easily via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple cards to set up the various features of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ e.@@ The option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ This will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s settings folder ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list while editing , automatically save the current playlist in the exit of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
keeping the current piece visible during piece changes causes the play@@ lists to roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
switching to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can custom@@ ise &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting Custom fon@@ ts the otherwise gray highlighted section is enabled . you can select Scrip@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , Player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the source of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use the color selection activated for foreground and background color activated .
resume playback at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will continue with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box Shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colours for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to specify the screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to display the O@@ SD .
the Audio Output flash@@ card allows you to select an audio driver from the drop@@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the card collection collection is used to set all the settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the selected as well as their sub @-@ folders for music .
monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear in the playlist browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card menu addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transfer the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar interpre@@ ters : after enabling this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will be called to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ et@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection .
this is mostly due to the fact that Tag@@ lib file crashes when reading the met@@ a information . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.@@ g &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail will open automatically in case of a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ inst@@ ated with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are ignored . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : icon look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then please check whether Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
you can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do pieces of music come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation columns must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press D@@ el on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu Rem@@ ove From Play@@ list .
drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , next to the addition button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably you don &apos;t have the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format .
it may ! maybe you are using F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder are included ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( for example , sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS deco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) .
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less bear@@ ers respond to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute the logs , once as system administrators and once as your normal user . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module ( you will find the module folder with follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and restart the log @-@ register . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set setting Amar@@ ok ... Output audio output to the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 @-@ code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ t@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ box on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being taken care of . of course you are allowed to take this issue by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece on each different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window is gone . the information shown here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can also be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .

the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to use play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :

if the playlist becomes longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files . in the event the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and dropping . once you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the return button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter words separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order . then , the entries will be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also do &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; hence sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competitor to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
fla@@ c : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is , for example , possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you &apos;ll need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ M@@ ger : a feature set fully equipped to edit , dis@@ assemble and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what is supposed to happen , just as if you were called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called File C@@ lose .
if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you directly draw the files from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is the ? help ( achiev@@ able via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the media , it only hides the previously imported files .
this allows for copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn at some point later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn at some point later . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the Bur@@ n button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
a previously dra@@ ined DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the contents view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , its contents are displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locking and blocking the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line doesn &apos;t have any real function , it looks pretty and separates the view from the views from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; general program settings can be made here . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with one &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial , which will give you a preference .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P features , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
void Cop@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void bit@@ C@@ d ( ) void copyright ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void copyright
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above mentioned K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void of void reference ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quart@@ et ) void reference void reference ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String Quart@@ et ) void reference void reference ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Dat@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; a read @-@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders encoding these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install anything themselves . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Which enco@@ der gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protects the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass a protected audio CD ; in any case , you can avoid buying pir@@ ated audio CDs ; s !
while the setup needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained . this will guide ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
it can collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , all manually captured .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB file request of the CD data according to the arrangement of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when an enco@@ der is configured in the enco@@ der settings tab in the setup dialog - encoding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that the enco@@ der in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog before .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ les ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator , with different cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approx . 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good for music of teenagers , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / needed with &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; parameters that can be needed ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what is fre@@ ed@@ b : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information rather than themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( remark of the translator : it is meant by the author ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being added to the &amp; CD ; neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ Creator ; is actively selecting a check box ( sending one address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address than the ones in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when invo@@ king the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator , when using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from CD and CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must first be installed , if this has not happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read messages on it , and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you have to install c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the / usr / share / cd directory is made and that you have write rights on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them at any reading of a CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the read @-@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing records of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in the case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are com@@ fy and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the internet .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually insert everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of matching pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to disc@@ ard the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can also be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than a wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are com@@ fy and want to collect the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data fet@@ ched . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of extrac@@ ting them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , please refer to the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the CD is successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - En@@ ter the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags , you have unlimited field length , at least what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the end @-@ to @-@ end CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off . make sure all pieces are selected or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
once you have started reading the selection process by clicking on the button selection , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see you when trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered in this example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is encoding piece 1 in MP3 format .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in the case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help such as the program can be customized to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still best reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? whoever reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended . if you want to add or modify something useful , it is only after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion .
strange , if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke game from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound @-@ Project Driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the respective process .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , a piece plays , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller .
if you find a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the template LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space key acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; play .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section stands how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize . click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired names in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding the button . it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic added to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row from the menu Colle@@ ctions sub@@ menu , the songs will be played in the order in which they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back to a song , select the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow key on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translate into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which transforms all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , making it possible to sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ us cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ tual ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section speci@@ fies how General MIDI Pat@@ ches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the sequence and leave no line for one of 128 instruments .
if your keyboard does not support a rif@@ le shot ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound represents the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are ima@@ ged on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as are their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
the maps are mainly used to map the sounds of the percussion channel . for example , take a look at the provided maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , simply do this in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name Name is needed for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole host of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button will not be green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the View channel view : settings
the Tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed , etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
be sure to enable automatic add to the collection before . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) . in this way , I need to change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn on the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so adjust the settings Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to further write to &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to write MIDI files , make music and prove pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . I &apos;ll list all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want to ) . but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get any money from anyone for it . I want to emphasize that I am programming only because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
thank you also Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tho@@ ke , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the web , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of supported formats , supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as for playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can also be changed by an editor , and next edit mode . by cli@@ cking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , select play@@ lists from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of Start @-@ Animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ dis@@ m sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here you can see the mp@@ layer output .
there is no tab for that playback device in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is ready to start in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . the started process is called cra@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always use a given back end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , use the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
at the time the origin of this documentation is used , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , ver@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any clu@@ e how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is supposed to be user root after the device is plu@@ gged in . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; ki@@ le ; requires .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to access the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the ki@@ le ; -@@ website should be made .
if questions arise when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed in the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; counter@@ top . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the ability to use all &amp; latex ; offers the possibility to complete , compile , re@@ process and error search within the source text as well as conversion and view tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; posters ; and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for and latex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , also a lay@@ man ( English lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of latex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the initi@@ ation contains at least the command \ \ document@@ arily , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } .
the quick entry assistant at &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , letter &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
coding : hereby the character encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as a standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; latex . for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t need to worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and more detailed information will be given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; if you want to see greater ranges of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will be saved by the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; ki@@ le , automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be created in the menu settings dialog . this function can be set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and most sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex files ; retri@@ eval can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI file ( constra@@ ined D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the common output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used to use the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in &amp; latex ; the pres@@ et search is the exact opposite .
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : der &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is called &quot; dis@@ appointments &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick construction .
the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Avail@@ able &amp; latex , orders for sub@@ division are :
the selection box for further items is to enter articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , an image or another element .
reference : used for reference to a designated description ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e@@ e is used for the definition of the font . it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text , the fusion no@@ des , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when invo@@ king &amp; ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the \ \ document@@ range contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or the quick construction of a button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if the compilation of the document fails , the logging should be checked for errors . if it is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font palette is created , and only a few columns should have another font .
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin to environment } up to \ \ \ \ \ \ \ environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ st@@ ut@@ ations , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { $ emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ r@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background is presented to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least one quotation , a few places in bold and itali@@ c form and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer must close its window .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eg . D e V ice I n@@ depends ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) by means of file printing ( in the viewer ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file is made from the &amp; latex ; source text is created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; binary files . for this purpose only Modern can be set up under Settings box ... Building Tools can be selected .
to execute the pre @-@ selection , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on the pre @-@ selection process . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is then taken .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; opened and jump to the corresponding line .
if there is no error when using a quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; a error can be present . if there is an error , this will be sum@@ mar@@ ised in the log file or message window .
the Log@@ ging File will explain the source code error source . in the editor , the heads of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for the cracks between the errors . the log file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . to view the fla@@ wed line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
once clicking on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when choosing empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
hi@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; most often use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by means of a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings General .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of the standard template .
a template can be created from any kind of latex ; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility to read and extract from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for program@@ mers ; can be done in the menu directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to know more about &amp; plac@@ ards , and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical and latex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of virtually any of the commands that can be found in &amp; latex , as well as its syntax .
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that this means that \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a defined Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the different kinds of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional boun@@ ces . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries Edit boun@@ ces or the corresponding key rings enable the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically triggered at the first input of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; brands ; already offers excellent opportunities , were added into &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sty@@ les , the following commands are included for the selection of text :
this expanded meaning only includes tables , and latex , and all other lines of the source code . the only beu@@ ati@@ ful thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the Ab@@ sin@@ ews are separated by two empty lines .
this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command is also called &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a ¼ ck@@ layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) exp@@ ires at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; kate ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit removal , the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit drop@@ let he@@ el .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex . therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit environment for a more effective simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the area .
when the cur@@ sor is before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the above @-@ mentioned environment can be lost quickly . this command completes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closed bracket .
when the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ v@@ ature of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jump@@ ed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a number of ne@@ sted welded group clips , the above @-@ mentioned group can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as a yar@@ n . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple application marks . also for the completion of the application , the sign &quot; is used .
this automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
it is also possible to use foreign language settings ( e.g. au@@ german or French ) and thus German or French symbols . there are also many other languages available .
when shift shift ; enter &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a Listen environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set and latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to one another . when using Shift , Alt ; amp ; seeks &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab is unfortunately not the corresponding tab , add &amp; ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ) . there are three different modes available for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings ... Compl@@ et@@ ely adjusted .
at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when using the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , as a result , the list of references is possible . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by typing another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . of course , the descriptions are removed when choosing a command . alternatively , can be inserted from &amp; ki@@ le , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing snap @-@ mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jump mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
you can adjust settings to these lists . you can select different parts lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as extensions of the general language use can be selected .
command mode is not useful for setting environments . it always needs to begin a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the de@@ ple@@ tion mode will result in a large @-@ scale list of environment commands . on the other hand , the vic@@ ini@@ ties are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the complete destruction of environments .
when inv@@ ading the space on the menu of the En@@ try environment or the key root Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears to \ \ begin . then the ambient temperature compensation can be continued in the simplest way and by using the input button .
once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... box ; All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of the Complete Package Mode for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of cut@@ outs , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le Complete . as an example of a collection list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is in complete mode of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar is initiated , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ chers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many authors are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the completeness for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete can be switched off . here , the threshold for the display of the compensation can also be specified .
the missing files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the graphic design of the graphics makes it easy to insert graphics as simple as possible . in view of the basic principles of graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for descriptions and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for the viewer as well as the ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used for the key viewer Alt ; 2 . afterwards the DVI @-@ file can be converted to a PS file via Alt ; 4 .
when using the quick construction command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time .
a new project will be about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administr@@ ated above scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished yet and can still be used in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with lots of documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and another and latex ; -@@ Reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible assistance offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application contains tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and this for a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest asset is the search for package names or banners . from &amp; ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly and latex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ de ; is also a part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project and to sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; information on the contribut@@ ors there is in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ho@@ ber &amp; ki@@ le ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file will be read from &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you will use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . in the Sig@@ natur@@ a section you will receive a lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you &apos;ll have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar .
in this case , you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom Button down on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you will need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows my way and how outstanding it is . if we take it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply let the current working folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an issue on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be checked by means of a different file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ format@@ med file is well , click the Well @-@ For@@ med Test selection .
to use one &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection necessary .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location , you use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and clicking the S@@ etze site . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting up your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something special happens in the project . one example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file to CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
input comment is simple . either the comment entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the registered nick@@ name of the team member , role in the project from the following options : team Leader Sub@@ project Leader C@@ ould be given the appropriate area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles @-@ names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and tags : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / S@@ ump@@ y of Tags : large / S@@ ump@@ y of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower case means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
optional Tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
do not automatically include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
automatically update start and end @-@ tag : when turned on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic set @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for det@@ ecting various types of files . by means of the Standard Res@@ et button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise file @-@ opened files ( where the file &apos;s encoding can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a folder ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dependent views . it comp@@ lies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep can be automatically opened during a change in the structure tree . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those with no element found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P &apos;s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third parties , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard directory like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select allows to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , the de@@ bu@@ gger was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; fits .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counter to de@@ bu@@ gging session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or stops listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger Output function .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include it will be corrected in@@ correctly .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if it were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be used to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type editing pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / or c@@ ss files . tag folders include two file types , the tags file and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) to insert text and instructions in a document faster than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without danger of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing as a single element of itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Class type Class . the class name for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid for Type @-@ method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
when yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but look at &amp; &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog box is above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = default 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can set actions with Settings ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking on the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; the current short@@ cut can be removed with K@@ 1 .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the input field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day has attributes and you are planning its use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available , so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ or ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol , that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose editing size to others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view of the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually displayed as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this icon will insert &amp; lt ; start@@ files ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set the tool@@ bar preferences . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by half of all symbols to make sure everything is working .
if New XML does not exist , it will create the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust its file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; Fol@@ der will be shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for usage by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
mit &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various points , there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing . to make a different contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource dialog , you will need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , Up@@ load tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ x@@ XML format . there is the easier way to automatically convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string containing in ! Doc@@ type Day , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to take full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ lows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please consult , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tab@@ s with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all folder , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or carry out CVS orders to the current document .
right @-@ clicking in the editor section leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top of the Editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be executed using the contex@@ tual menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more about templates is available in .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element in the document . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre@@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed provide all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in front of your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the most magnificent web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible this is possible , but allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs .
allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly converted into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting assignment .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
screen and turn on the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries pre@@ dict@@ ably or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team for the tool@@ bar available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access them . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; who has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and there is not a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activating or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent integration means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will disable it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the kate or version .
very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes may need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of documents , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter environment but has not yet been implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in best from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and templates by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static web content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ like scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook it up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to your preferences .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hooks , or by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new Project Wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or using the Shift + Shift key .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards are possible ) which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in , troubleshooting is described .
in the profiles upload profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by using a custom tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify , or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . currently , this behavior cannot be affected .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when generating programs . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted on the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to create tool@@ bars using the tool@@ bar menu . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the section adding tool@@ bars .

templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets , and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be edited by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually more specialized documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area over and over again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note down to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template Save As a local template ...
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select Text in your document and click File As template Save sel@@ ections as local / Project templates . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged along with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates . each folder is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described models ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set so , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;re likely to be in a root folder .
allows previous or filed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with custom he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing out right mouse button ) using a complete command file for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the v@@ oh@@ em@@ ial of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . pressing F@@ 9 activ@@ ates the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , keeping the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small sp@@ out for fast computers and a large span for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to choose the document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding . this allows you to modify the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is unique . the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual in a word processor . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted as usual .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed each other anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
stop in a template , at a place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , wa@@ xed re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded SCM file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command checks for a partial or complete match with a vag@@ ue named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with every QNAP NAS that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and time number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many points . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there were no references to places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ value file browser .
this is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check code frequently , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anger if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
the opening dialogue allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialogue notes your selection and indicates it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while .
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , the color you see differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separating the sum@@ ming column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to spend the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference at the same time has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or Ign@@ oring C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if it is checked , whatever you select will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and no manual copying is required . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use return line + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line end of the source files , so you should not use k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , you will see differences in itali@@ c script . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered in@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press enter or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , any sel@@ ections will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board , then copying the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system you use .
the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when merging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a &apos; \ \ r &apos; cart and a new@@ line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others will only save a new@@ spr@@ int &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , carriage returns will be made visible , but will be treated like a white character . during the merge , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
this option is de@@ activated in default . comments are treated as changes in white characters .
search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is resum@@ ed .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already one such backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
a short note about the local code is displayed above the selection fields for encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or reviews columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ oring C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded Excel column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just leave out the less important windows . ( this option is in the Window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide un@@ expectedly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge again , the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command for line sequences to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression that fits all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now , a pre@@ processing command for line sequences is needed which removes the automatically generated text : \ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ $ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach mark between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so almost deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor looks at the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and , in the worst case , destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes for each object a suggestion to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate co@@ effici@@ ents and show the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... sel@@ ects selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , then folder 3 is used as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will inform a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed folded . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories and all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold up all directories .
double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the interaction queue can not be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
in the case of identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . with folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchron@@ ize di@@ rs . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file B ; copied directly after merging , B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during merging , one file is executed after the other . you status column shows the skill if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should check out a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all interaction actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge operation .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , C is used as the destination , while B is selected as the destination and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the list menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to bring only the current entry , select Run action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid merging actions exist due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Exec@@ ute , Sim@@ ulate , and Ab@@ ort .
select Sim@@ ulations once you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , you can re @-@ launch / resume directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you encounter a mistake , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been individually merged , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous poin@@ ts@@ . marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to only compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . this can be useful e.g. when copying the modified date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the rules for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . the results of merging files will also be saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , copying the newer file is proposed as an action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , as it is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of single files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally , the folder merge view stays visible while merging single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can turn off the main window in the pop @-@ up menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start folder merging . you can also use the current file merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be terminated and the file will not be merged again if you start folder merging .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory Menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DB@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative und@@ . or .. .@@ This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of the Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference be@@ holder in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose the file has a unified file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part execution , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path , or they will go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is not treated as identical . if similar lines are &apos; next to each other , this is is this subscribe is often the case .
the editor notes for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
after removing the text , all of a sudden , No sr@@ c is left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and lots of people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems in comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position resp@@ . replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program , you need to re @-@ read the current folder after changes to these options . )
this will also cause identical files to be copied when merging into the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C lab@@ eling under the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button respectively .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , if an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1. desktop .
when this field is selected , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shown .
when this field is enabled , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas are displayed to allow them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid it appears , as is made from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ections of switches ... allow the dialog settings to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen slow . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; you can use a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a select window in the following .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the Shift key , or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the refresh of the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , no@@ vice ( with the button document re@@ loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a magni@@ fier ; to use a magni@@ fier area , use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause pain to every mou@@ sec@@ lick .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that each mouse click treats pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by mouse clicks and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
the intelligent shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be done by the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , exec@@ utes a mouse click .
if Intel@@ ligent shift is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after holding down the mouse button wa@@ its before it lets the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse @-@ shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these moves are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later pull the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce &amp; k@@ de response times ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of at which point a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear soon if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a move is just started . if you use the intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute clicks and set the cur@@ sor somewhere else .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral zone of your desktop if you want to make a keyboard input .
I try to work with intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t make it to edit lyrics .
the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the cli@@ p@@ board or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent shift only when you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when moving the move time . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is frozen . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain to be activated .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling activity to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can also drag and drop with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passage book . from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without having to type in . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a run memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have correctly set up k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the drive memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to invo@@ ke the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ori@@ d language mer@@ it is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the drive memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second selection box closing the edit window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages book is to be saved automatically when closing the processing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passages book will not be saved . select Save Before Save , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passage book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is determined simply by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add new words automatically to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is split . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text cut is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ander .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text cut is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ander .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if there is text in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected movements of the exp@@ ander .
if this menu entry is selected , a sli@@ dable tool bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a postpon@@ able bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is arranged by default above the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location .
you probably have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the flash@@ card voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ett . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the lyrics in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax willingly swal@@ lowed the last character of the text , so that an additional sign needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / s@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v

the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently under development in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ori@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set it , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth , if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk to output text by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is saved , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer needs to be installed .
for more detailed user documentation , help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service which allows any application to read text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; dic@@ ts ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
the speech output is used by the speech speech speech tool , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the &amp; k@@ de voice output service ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ori@@ d on kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading texts from a website or sharing of it .
a text editor module , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , there are discussions on and kt@@ ts ; subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use the tool , you will need to install and adjust speech speech speech to speech professionals .
at the first start of kt@@ ori@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card holder will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card menu General is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you start &amp; Desktop ; otherwise the program speed dispat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the map tab spokes@@ man in kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr , the card holder will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a spokes@@ man from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
choose a type of voice here , three male and three female voices as well as a young and female voice are available .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card holder . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to make the T@@ TS service run by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the cardboard card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
tick this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . once this start is successful , the card card orders are displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ul@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the Control bar system area , it disappears again as soon as the read is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start , pause , pause and record text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de , cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the flash@@ card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Book ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can read the text displayed . first , check the text you want to read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; gt ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about the events set out by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the &amp; k@@ de &apos;s IR@@ C program , you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry displays noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filter for string replacement offers a good option in &amp; kt@@ ales ; wrong emphasized or fla@@ wed messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ons ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech speech speech . it is useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid specific fla@@ ws of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
news is the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &apos;re reading &amp; eg ; a long text read on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the remainder are simple text orders . each order that you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; exactly one such one reads , this output will pause and end .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ actors . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
character Trans@@ lator replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined string sub@@ stitution filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; Converter uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ml .
with speech selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card holder , you can read text from K@@ DE messages above .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters established . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample for setting string asser@@ tion filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the creation column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained by q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 displays , you may only enter cop@@ ete .
the string release filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box dialog . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s way .
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package ambig@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speech selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ales ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card holder . with the Spe@@ aker selection filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can use it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speakers you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to see the dialogue of speech selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or to delete all settings .
the speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice @-@ sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ori@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . first launch kt@@ ori@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ul@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; reform@@ ulation filter , but when using the module for festival web@@ pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do this even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only bub@@ bling . what can I do about it ?
make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct language value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved by a string release filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages may be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ales ; , for information not included in this manual .
the speech speech tool &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and work for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages c@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for mapping or downloaded the tar@@ ball created each night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before you start using , check whether speech syn@@ thesizer is working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the establishment of speech @-@ dispat@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is split into individual sentences . the user can return set or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the most appropriate speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
if you click Add Spo@@ kes@@ person on Add , and therefore insert a spokes@@ man in the list or click Edit , the Cart@@ on map will display speaker setup . as an example , the device for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text passed to the festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ales , this setting is automatically made . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and show this grey , the selected voice does not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is more quickly syn@@ thes@@ ized ( with greater memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window t@@ m@@ gr will be shown at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon kt@@ ul@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is checked and t@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the precisely edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card holder .
using the buttons in this series , you can move forward or backward on the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be copied and t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio map audio . see also .
here , only text assignments are performed and managed . outputs of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or trac@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module .
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ min ; % is equivalent to about half and 200 ; % about double normal speech speed . to make these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , you choose standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &apos;re reading &amp; eg ; just let a long text read on a web page , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and spending of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications appear .
tick this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications . if this setting is un@@ checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; Desktop ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; By .
use this field to specify what you want to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want to use . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card list speaker . see also this .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to store the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button Lo@@ ad to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds begin to sub@@ divide words into individual sentences . thus , you can start to start reading faster with reading , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the set limit identi@@ fier filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit recognition filter is set automatically as the default . you can modify its settings or add additional set limit recognition filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the language of speakers by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the list of speakers , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then start faster with the reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit identi@@ fier filter will be set up automatically when you start kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only be removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit identi@@ fier filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( ch@@ ats ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal sentence identi@@ fier filter from accidentally , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c included .

I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ori@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / cap@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ve / cap@@ s@@ d / cap@@ s@@ d / cap@@ s@@ fes@@ int / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio map audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card reader device . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ forming filter , and set up the microphone speed .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .

the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you wish to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes on le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from the phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text di@@ phone .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; files are installed in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows managing the network interfaces , routing and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; called ..
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; shown . the Network Set@@ ting module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the Network Set@@ ting module , it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual option is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date . by checking the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be made permanently .
change the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means that the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the button system management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Network Interface Panel :
settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to set up the device in the dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings will display the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . activating an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the list name resolution makes it easy to manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted in priority by selecting an entry or descending or descending in the list with buttons down or down .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group Calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names known to name refers to host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list contains some well @-@ known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still under review will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Def@@ ault calcul@@ ator will display .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command in one &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient to install &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de suff@@ ices ; not , but in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other applications .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be deployed in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in other networks , on &amp; off , the network administrator is the contact point providing a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP re@@ direction .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , where they are located in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is any other content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is dump@@ ed by the script in the Su@@ SE config file . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example , gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard UNIX commands to find time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; we@@ ars the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre @-@ tension@@ ing force on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detect &amp; dat ; the pre@@ tension , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index of the tape is to be re@@ created .
when everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by fold the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a message by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape has to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat , continues with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you hit the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can still check the selected files and change settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the backup dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape index file by means of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders specified in backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be registered separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file from the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the button files &amp; quot ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape device .
if this setting is active , it transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try to lock the dis@@ cards from the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ecting the tape . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is the option enabled , tries to change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only contain one storage block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems appearing on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; experienced users can provide quick access , for example , to information about problems appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; features that allow the individual protocol lines of a protocol file to be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; first , try to open the most important log file of the system - the system protocol . if you don &apos;t see it , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; most probably do not run with system administrators .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion , or after entered strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines are displayed that match to the selected filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if there is a string of the filter search term in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system protocol , select the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so you will see &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; all log lines that were sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of the stage error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than log lines of the level indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down in the setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ logs .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of Supply of &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ logs ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named below ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming standard for system start @-@ up when starting up the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to convert a machine to system V in@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first in / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly into / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you will need a script for any system service you want to start when starting the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , but system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is only launched once . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located at / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if it doesn &apos;t have much use for it . you can also configure a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the initial area , you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up , then proceed to repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; furthermore , I could also have a user @-@ run level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between levels or change the position inside a level by pulling it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or position ) . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new zone . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection top or bottom of the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , drag it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it in the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or the name of an entry manually , press the key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ eling . what can I do ?
enter LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this program refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or the entry in the File menu item .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user and group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the password management card menu appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
this card card only appears if there is space limitation ( quota ) enabled and initi@@ alized for at least a built @-@ in file system ( see quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with limited space limitation .
the card@@ holder group informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating system add , remove , change and more .
